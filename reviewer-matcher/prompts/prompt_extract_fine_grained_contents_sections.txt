Title:
Design and effectiveness of a psychological Immersive and Interactive 360º Virtual Reality intervention focused on personal Recovery in people with Schizophrenia (ViReSI).

Abstract:
The ViReSI project aims to design, develop, and evaluate the effectiveness of a 360º Immersive and Interactive Virtual Reality (IIVR) psychological intervention focused on personal recovery for people with schizophrenia. The intervention is based on metacognitive training and involves five sub-studies: identifying relevant IIVR scenarios through focus groups with schizophrenia patients; designing and developing the ViReSI intervention using IIVR techniques and vision computer methods; conducting a pilot study to test the intervention’s acceptability, usability, safety, and satisfaction; evaluating the efficacy of the intervention through a randomized clinical trial compared to standard treatment; and exploring structural brain changes after the intervention. ViReSI represents a pioneering approach in group psychological interventions, offering new forms of interaction and immersion in everyday scenarios.
