Given the title of a biomedical study and a list of methods used in it (including types of analyses, tools, technologies, approaches), please:

1. Classify each method into:
   - Standard: General research methods (e.g.: Randomized controlled trial, Cohort study, Focus group, Statistical analyses)
   - Specific: Methodologies, techniques, tools or approaches specific to the study (e.g.: DNA methylation analysis, Functional MRI, Machine learning)
2. Summarize each method or family of methods used, omitting details such as sample sizes, number of participants.
   
Formatting instructions:

    Please return the output in valid JSON format with beginning and end marks, with the following structure.
  
    ```json
    {{
      "methods_standard": ["First standard method here", "Second standard method here", ...],
      "methods_specific": ["First specific method here", "Second specific method here", ...]
    }}
    ```

Note:
It is possible that there are no standard methods listed. In this case return an empty list [] for the "methods_standard" field.

*** Return only the JSON content, and nothing else. ***

Title:

A Multimodal Investigation of Mitochondrial and Metabolomic Factors in Brain Health and Chronic Disease Risk: A Randomized Trial and Cohort Study of Over 10,000 Participants

Methods:

- Randomized clinical trial
- Measurement of circulating-cell-free mitochondrial DNA copy number
- Metabolomic glycoprotein and lipoprotein profiles analysis
- Pearson Product Moment Correlations
- ANOVA
- Cohort study
- Food frequency questionnaires
- Behavioral scales and computer-based tests
- Machine learning for risk algorithm development
- Neuroimaging studies to explore structural brain changes
- Data analysis of over 10,000 individuals and 200 risk factors

Expected output:

    ```json
    {{
      "methods_standard": [
        "Randomized clinical trial",
        "Statistical analyses",
        "Cohort study",
