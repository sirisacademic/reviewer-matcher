Title:
Enhancing Resident Immunity against Sexually Transmitted Infections (SPIRITS)

Abstract:
This project aims to enhance mucosal immunity to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) by focusing on the role of resident memory immune cells in the cervicovaginal mucosa. Using a human cervical explant model, the research will explore how pathogen-related signals and changes in the local tissue environment, such as inflammation, hormones, and microbial dysbiosis, affect immune responses. The goal is to identify signals that effectively engage mucosal immunity and improve vaccine design against STIs, addressing challenges like asymptomatic infections and antibiotic resistance. The project expects to provide insights into the unique features of resident immune cells and their role in protective immunity.

Topics:
- Gynaecologic conditions
- Male reproductive system conditions
- Sexual and Reproductive Health (not related to illnesses)
- Reproductive medicine
- Pregnancy, birth and postpartum


Expected output:

```json
{{
    "Gynaecologic conditions": {{
        "response": "YES",
        "justification": "The project focuses on the cervicovaginal mucosa."
    }},
    "Male reproductive system conditions": {{
        "response": "NO",
        "justification": "The project does not focus on male reproductive system conditions."
    }},
    "Sexual and Reproductive Health (not related to illnesses)": {{
        "response": "NO",
        "justification": "The project is focused on illness-related sexual and reproductive health."
    }},
    "Reproductive medicine": {{
        "response": "NO",
        "justification": "The project focuses on mucosal immunity rather than on reproductive medicine."
    }},
    "Pregnancy, birth and postpartum": {{
        "response": "NO",
        "justification": "The study does not involve pregnancy, birth, or postpartum conditions."
    }}
}}
