## Introduction

**Reviewer Matcher** is a Python-based software designed to automate the assignment of expert reviewers to project proposals.
Leveraging advanced NLP techniques, the tool ensures that reviewers' expertise aligns closely with the objectives and methodologies of the proposals.

### Project bjectives

The project aims to:

1. Facilitate the reviewer assignment process for project proposals.
2. Improve alignment between reviewer expertise and project requirements.
3. Provide a flexible, modular framework for managing data and assignments.

## Architecture Overview

The tool is modular, with components for data preprocessing, metadata enrichment, similarity calculation, and assignment optimization.
Refer to individual files for detailed documentation on each module.

## Preliminary code structure [to be updated]

In the image, we provide an overview of the core modules of the tool, highlighting its fundamental components and their primary functions. Each module represents a key area of functionality, illustrating how different parts of the tool work together to deliver a cohesive experience. This breakdown serves as an introduction to the essential building blocks of the tool, helping users understand its architecture and operational flow.

## Repository

Instead of a single main branch, we use two branches to record the history of the project:

- `develop`: development and default branch for new features and bug fixes.
- `main`: production branch is used to deploy the server components to the `production` environment.
