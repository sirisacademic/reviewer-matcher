# Reviewer matcher ðŸ¤º
Automatic tool to support the assignment of reviewers to project proposals
### Objective
- Project: Develop a system to facilitate the assignment of expert reviewers to project proposals.
- Current step: Obtain a set of potential reviewers such that their expertise aligns closely with the project's objectives and methods.

### Approach
- Leverage NLP techniques to implement a multi-stage process involving data retrieval, content enrichment, and similarity computation.
- Obtain, as a result, a score and rank for each potential expert-project assignment.

## Preliminary code structure

In the image, we provide an overview of the core modules of the tool, highlighting its fundamental components and their primary functions. Each module represents a key area of functionality, illustrating how different parts of the tool work together to deliver a cohesive experience. This breakdown serves as an introduction to the essential building blocks of the tool, helping users understand its architecture and operational flow.

Instead of a single main branch, we use two branches to record the history of the project:

- `develop`: development and default branch for new features and bug fixes.
- `main`: production branch is used to deploy the server components to the `production` environment.
