# Branching Model

We follow a two-branch model:

- **`main`**: Production-ready code.

- **`develop`**: Integration branch for ongoing development.

### Workflow

1. Create feature branches from `develop`.

2. Merge completed features back into `develop`.

3. Periodically merge `develop` into `main` for production releases.
