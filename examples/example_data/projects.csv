HRCS22_00936,Developing a Digital Health-enabled Intervention to tackle Multimorbidity in Primary care in India,"More than a quarter of adult patients attending primary care facilities in India have multimorbidity. However, national health programmes are disease-centric, including the ongoing National Programme for Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), which caters to large population groups in primary care for a range of chronic conditions. The specific objectives of the proposed research work in the Indian state of Tripura are: a) To discover major multimorbidity patterns relevant for NPCDCS in primary care; and b) To develop a digital health-enabled intervention, targeting major multimorbidity patterns, relevant for NPCDCS, to improve targeting and delivery of clinical services in primary care. A digital tool- comprising clinical decision support and electronic health record- is deployed in 40 primary care facilities in Tripura to aid the healthcare team in managing six chronic conditions - hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, alcoholism and tobacco use- for the past 29 months. In such patient's record, information on the presence of eight additional chronic conditions is also routinely recorded. This dataset will be used for discovering multimorbidity patterns. Using these inputs, and expert consultations, we will develop a digital health-enabled intervention for the management of multimorbidity following the MRC framework for developing complex interventions. To guide intervention development, a theory of change will be constructed, covering the building blocks of the health system and other contextual factors.  Using mixed methods, we will develop a prototype intervention and pilot it in two health facilities for assessing feasibility, developing mitigation strategies for barriers, identifying potential indicators for the process of care and patient-level outcomes, sample size and recruitment feasibility for planning an application for controlled evaluation of the intervention developed in a future trial."
HRCS22_01305,Cancer Epidemiology,"We will build on our work showing that the malignant and non-malignant consequences of oncogenic infections (including HIV) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Uganda and that lifestyle risk-factors such as tobacco are currently relatively less important in this setting. We will i) examine the transmission dynamics of oncogenic infections, ii) initiate preventive interventions and, iii) conduct aetiological research on specific cancers. For example, the determinants and immune correlates of suppression and transmission of Kaposi’s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (which exists at higher prevalence in our rural cohort than has been reported anywhere else in the world) will be studied. Working within our population platforms, we will: i) examine the impact of a national HPV vaccination scheme on circulating subtypes of HPV; ii) assess the feasibility of H. pylori eradication in a population in which infection is ubiquitous; iii), conduct a feasibility study of Hepatitis C Virus cure and iv) develop further work on understanding liver disease and progression of chronic infection with Hepatitis B virus. We will also seek external funding to conduct a randomised-controlled trial of low-technology methods (a package of post-harvest measures) in combination with a bio-control approach to reduce aflatoxin levels, which we have previously shown to be an important exposure. Comparative research on the epidemiology and aetiology of haematological malignancies in Uganda and in the UK will be further developed, in conjunction with studies of the HIV-related cancers Kaposi’s sarcoma and conjunctival carcinoma."

HRCS22_13206,Improving care for Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome patients: clinical and genetic analysis of a unique cohort.,"We propose a clinical PhD project focusing on the risk of malignancies in Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) and increasing awareness of BHD. Although the knowledge on the main features of BHD (skin, lungs, kidneys) has increased over the years, many unanswered questions remain that are highly relevant for diagnosis and management of BHD patients. Our large cohort of (>300) BHD patients allows us to study clinical aspects of BHD in detail. Furthermore, the size of our cohort and the frequency at which new families are diagnosed, indicates that BHD is an underdiagnosed disease. These issues form the basis of our two aims: 1. to evaluate the (individualized) risks for malignancies in patients with BHD, and 2. to increase awareness of BHD among other physicians. Our project is subdivided into four objectives. In the first objective, we will re-evaluate the lifetime risk for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients with BHD along with possible additional risk factors for RCC, such as genotype, personal history of pneumothorax or fibrofolliculomas, renal cysts, family history of RCC, and lifestyle. In the second objective, we will focus on malignancies other than RCC, and compare their prevalence in patients with BHD, with their family members without BHD, and with general Dutch cancer statistics in a retrospective study. The results of these two objectives will provide important information for patients and physicians, and they will be used to re-evaluate the BHD guidelines. In the third and fourth objective, we aim to develop a website and an information leaflet for all Dutch pulmonologists, dermatologists and urologists to increase awareness of BHD among other physicians. The website will also provide patients with a source of information about BHD, and can be used to obtain informed consent for research."
HRCS22_13631,Defining the molecular landscape of paediatric and adolescent acute leukaemia in Tanzania,"The treatment of childhood blood cancers has improved hugely over the past few decades, and most cases of leukaemia in young people in the UK and Ireland are now cured. Much of this improvement has come from research into the genetic mutations in leukaemia cells, which helps determine how each patient with blood cancer should best be treated. Similar improvements have not been possible in low-income countries, mainly due to lack of financial resources. However scientific advances mean that it is now relatively quick and inexpensive to do comprehensive mutational testing known as ‘next-generation sequencing’. There is no longer a financial barrier to use this technology in places like Tanzania. We will use this technology to analyse mutations in leukaemia cells from children in Tanzania. This extends a long-standing collaboration with Children’s Health Ireland in Dublin, who have helped to support the treatment of Tanzanian children with cancer for over a decade. These tests will reveal the genetic mutations present in leukaemia cells of African patients for the first time. We will also use a scientific approach called ‘systems biology’ to investigate how these mutations drive cancer cells to grow and resist treatment. Systems biology methods use computer models to analyse the internal molecular wiring of leukaemia cells, allowing more efficient prediction of what treatments work best for each patient. This research will help us to accurately adapt therapies and to improve how African children with leukaemia are treated. We also predict that our results will flag cases that need specific ‘designer’ anti-leukaemia drugs, including less expensive medications that would be cost-effective in a lower income setting. This project will be a true collaboration with our colleagues in Tanzania and will build the long-term foundation for the clinical and scientific teamwork needed to overcome the global challenge of childhood cancer."
HRCS22_13649,"Investigating the interplay between early life factors, the genome and childhood cancer risk",The causes of childhood cancer are still largely unknown. Dr Natália Spitz Toledo Dias and her team will investigate whether environmental exposures during a baby’s life in the womb can cause changes to gene activity that may be associated with childhood cancer risk. The ultimate aim is to provide an evidence base for cancer prevention and discover the cancer’s molecular origins which could serve for targeted therapy. Dr Spitz Toledo Dias’ research is funded by Children with
HRCS22_13690,Contribution of fatty acid metabolism to the advanced and metastatic phenotype of pancreatic cancer,"Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an extremely lethal disease due to the current lack of effective therapies and extreme malignancy of the tumours once diagnosed. We have recently shown that PDAC is hierarchically organised with Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) constituting a major source for disease progression, including metastasis and relapse following chemotherapy. Interestingly, increased lipid scavenging and aberrant fatty acid metabolism have been linked to pancreatic tumour progression and poor prognosis in PDAC patients. We have recently reported that, in contrast to differentiated tumour cells, pancreatic CSCs are highly dependent on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS, Sancho et al, Cell Metabolism 2015). This metabolism confers the ability of using a wider range of substrates able to feed the TCA cycle, including fatty acids. Now, our preliminary results indicate that: 1) CSCs store and metabolise fatty acids for full tumorigenic capacity; 2) Energy deprivation promotes a highly dedifferentiated and aggressive phenotype through PPARdelta. We hypothesise that CSCs are able to modulate lipid storage/utilisation conferring them with high resilience and plasticity to adapt to the changing and challenging conditions during tumour progression and metastasis. Thus, in the present project we aim to analyse the specific role of fatty acid metabolism in the advanced and metastatic phenotype of PDAC by addressing the following three aims: 1. To study the role of lipid uptake and storage in CSCs to cope with situations of metabolic stress. 2. To investigate the role of PPARd in the acquisition of an advanced/metastatic phenotype in pancreatic cancer 3. To validate new therapeutic strategies targeting lipid metabolism Our ultimate aim is to identify and validate most effective CSC-targeting strategies with great translational potential, to improve the still miserable prognosis of PDAC patients."
HRCS22_13825,Improving the prediction of endometrial cancer risk using genetics,"Endometrial cancer (cancer of the uterine lining) is the most commonly diagnosed gynaecological cancer in developed countries, including Australia. Its incidence is rapidly increasing due to the ageing population and rising rates of obesity, the strongest known risk factor for endometrial cancer. This is a global problem, with a recent study reporting increased incidence rates of endometrial cancer in 26 of 43 countries studied. Unlike many cancer types, endometrial cancer-specific mortality has increased approximately 2% each year since 2008, in part due to its increased incidence.   Whilst the link between obesity and endometrial cancer risk is well-recognised, the mechanism for how this occurs is unknown. Understanding which characteristics of obesity are responsible for this relationship would provide vital information not only for informing endometrial cancer risk but also understanding the biology of this disease. How to use the information from obesity and other risk factors effectively to identify women at very high risk of endometrial cancer is not available. Harnessing these data would provide avenues for personalised risk prediction and targeted prevention interventions, including bariatric surgery.   Our research team leads the world’s largest genetic study of endometrial cancer through co-ordination of the Endometrial Cancer Association Consortium and identifying several genetic variants associated with endometrial cancer risk by genome-wide association study. We will use these genetic data to explore the relationship between endometrial cancer and specific obesity-related traits. We will construct endometrial cancer genetic risk scores, integrating genetic data from endometrial cancer risk factors to improve predictive capacity. Finally, we will assess the effect of intervention strategies on reducing endometrial cancer risk, providing essential data for clinical implementation of genetic risk scores for endometrial cancer prevention."
HRCS22_14116,IMAXT : imaging and molecular annotation of xenografts and tumors,"We propose to develop an entirely new way for scientists and physicians to understand cancer and predict its clinical behaviour. Our integrated approach will produce faithful three-dimensional representations of tumours and their host environments, wherein each cell is identified and molecularly annotated. These models will be presented in an interactive, virtual reality (VR) framework. Investigators will literally be able to walk inside a tumour, visualize the arrangement of tumour cells in relation to each environmental cell type, and perform interactive comparative molecular analyses in real time. We call this project IMAXT, Imaging and Molecular Annotation of Xenografts and Tumours. This approach harnesses our innate pattern recognition capabilities while maintaining the statistical rigour of molecular measurements. We wish not only to provide research tools that allow us to better understand how cancer develops and responds to therapy but also to transform the way that patients are diagnosed and treatments planned. Though this approach will be applicable to nearly all tumour types, we will begin in breast cancer, where both inter- and intra-individual heterogeneity are apparent and inform treatment decisions and prognosis."
HRCS22_14389,Unveiling mechanisms of tumor formation linked to BRCA2 mutation,"Inactivating germline mutations affecting a single copy of BRCA2 are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. However, what drives tumorigenesis in carriers of heterozygous BRCA2 mutations remains elusive. Moreover, BRCA2 deficient breast tumors lack a clear pathological phenotype that distinguishes them from sporadic cancers so the identification of a molecular signature of tumor formation associated with BRCA2 deficiency remains a challenge. Over recent years, many mutational signatures have been generated corresponding to different types of tumors including BRCA1/2 associated breast cancer. However, a defective BRCA2 gives rise to at least five mutational signatures and although they have been associated with homologous recombination (HR) deficiency, not all HR deficient genes lead to the same outcome. Furthermore, BRCA1 and BRCA2-mutated tumors can be discriminated against using these mutational signatures suggesting that mechanisms specific to each gene might be acting as potential cancer drivers. This is perhaps not surprising given the number of functions the two proteins exert in cells. As these different functions are mapped to distinct regions in the protein, we argue that different mutations in a single gene could reveal different mechanisms of tumor formation. Thus, by focusing on BRCA2-mutated tumors bearing a common pathogenic mutation we may unveil new mechanisms of tumor formation that would otherwise remain “hidden” in the population of BRCA2-mutated tumors. In addition, by recreating these mutations in relevant breast epithelial cells in heterozygosis we will be able to confirm which of the deregulated pathways observed in tumors are specifically due to BRCA2 mutation. Our preliminary results reveal a substitution signature prevalent in tumors bearing a specific pathogenic mutation and a deregulated pathway that was confirmed in our heterozygous cell system expressing the same mutation thus supporting this hypothesis. If confirmed, this project will have important clinical implications for prevention and treatment."
HRCS22_14562,Interaction between ionising radiation and genetic susceptibility in the aetiology of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,"The aetiology of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is largely unknown. Various studies have evaluated the role of ionising radiation and genetic susceptibility, but potential interaction between the two factors has rarely being examined. A major barrier to this type of research is the limited availability of both radiation and genetic data in existing studies. In the proposed project, we will leverage three studies from the Childhood Leukaemia International Consortium (CLIC), including the California Childhood Leukemia Study (CCLS), the Children’s Cancer Group (CCG) study of childhood ALL, and the Australian Study of Childhood ALL, to assess gene-radiation interaction in the aetiology of childhood ALL. Specifically, we will use the CCLS as the discovery/training dataset and the CCG and Australian studies as validation datasets. The CCLS has a case-control design (746 cases and 734 controls), while the CCG (n = 507) and Australian (n = 602) studies have a case-only design. All studies have collected very similar data on diagnostic X-rays that a child received before the diagnosis of ALL (and comparable date for controls), as well as whole-genome genotyping data. After conducting rigorous quality control, we will use both benchmark logistic-regression based analysis and more advanced regularization-based G-E interaction analysis methods recently developed by Co-Applicant Dr. S Ma’s group and others. With 2,589 subjects, the proposed project will provide an unprecedented opportunity to elucidate the potential aetiological role of gene-radiation interaction. Our findings will help clarify the biological pathways in leukemogenesis and identify children at high risk for ALL."
HRCS22_14594,Uncovering chromatin aberrations and molecular mechanisms associated with Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres in cancers,"Cancer cells gain replicative immortality by activating one of two telomere maintenance pathways. The aberrant ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres) pathway is found in 15% of cancers. Recent studies have identified chromatin factor ATRX and histone H3.3, which are frequently mutated in ALT cancers to be the key contributors to the ALT process. This breakthrough finding was facilitated by our original discoveries describing the roles of ATRX and H3.3 in controlling telomere function. Developing treatments for ALT cancers is challenging because of the current poor understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ALT activation and maintenance. This proposed study aims to uncover the molecular events and chromatin aberrations linked to  ATRX/H3.3 mutations and ALT by pursuing the following aims. First, using the ALT cell models we have created, we will perform in-depth chromatin and genomics analyses to explore how a disrupted KDM4 network drives ALT and oncogenesis in ATRX/H3.3 mutant cancers. This follows from our recent discovery that mutant H3.3 protein inhibits the function of KDM4 histone demethylases and this leads to substantial genome-wide changes in chromatin and transcription profiles. Second, we will perform proteomics analyses to identify new protein factors and regulatory pathways driving and sustaining ALT. These studies will uncover new insights into the ALT pathway and identify new therapeutic targets for ALT cancers."
HRCS22_14612,Checkpoint receptors expressed by dendritic cells- do they play a role in immunotherapies?,"The preliminary data of this proposal indicate that PD-1 and other checkpoint inhibitors are upregulated on DC upon activation both in vitro and in vivo. The panel of immune checkpoint proteins expressed by DC is governed by their specific subset. Moreover, human DC subsets show similar upregulation of PD-1 upon activation. Our examination of DC of PD-1 knockout mice has revealed that this protein is involved in the regulation of interferon-lambda production by DC subsets and in the T cell stimulation capacity of DC. This is particularly striking in the cross-presenting CD8+ DC, also known as conventional (c) DC1. Moreover, blocking of PD-1 signalling on human DC using small molecule inhibitors of PD-1 also leads to enhanced IFN-lambda producing capacity of cDC1. This project aims to decipher exactly how PD-1 signalling in DC affects transcriptional regulation and overall function in these cells. We will determine the PD-1 expression on DC in mouse models of induced melanoma. We will determine how PD-1 expression on DC determines outcome of melanoma growth pre and post treating with PD-1 blocking agents. Our work will reveal the functional significance of PD-1 expression by DC, revealing for the first time how these cells must be taken into account when designing immune checkpoint immunotherapies."
HRCS22_15702,Exploring mitochondria-to-nuclear communication in pancreatic cancer initiation,"Pancreatic cancer is characterized by poor overall survival and few efficacious therapeutic interventions. One area that has offered significant scope for further exploration are the numerous metabolic disturbances in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer.   Several of these derangements lead to imbalances in metabolites, including S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), α-ketoglutarate (αKG), and acetyl-CoA that are crucial to the regulation of epigenetic landscapes. Previously, I have demonstrated that pancreatic cancer initiation features abundant epigenetic reprogramming in the progression to neoplasia, and that the cytoplasmic enzyme ATP citrate lyase, which produces acetyl-CoA from citrate, is essential to the neoplastic process. In mouse models, Acly deletion diminishes the enhancement of histone acetylation that occurs in response to mutant Kras. The role of mitochondrial generation of the ACLY substrate citrate in acetyl-CoA availability, and the downstream effect of mutant Kras-induced acetyl-CoA on chromatin landscapes both remain unknown.  Our long-term goals are to identify how metabolic rewiring impacts the epigenome to facilitate alterations to cell fate in cancer. In this proposal, we intend to define the mitochondrial-to-nuclear connections that control epigenetic reprogramming in pancreatic cancer initiation. Building from my previous work, from Luca Scorrano’s expertise on mitochondrial dynamics, and from novel tools developed by Rohit Chandwani, our aim is to elucidate the mechanisms by which mitochondrial function controls the availability of exported citrate and nucleo-cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA. We will utilize several perturbations to citrate synthesis and export as well as to mitochondrial structure and function to delineate cross-talk between the mitochondria and the cytosol in controlling acetyl-CoA.   The data from this study will be incorporated in a larger framework, where using an orthogonal approach, we will examine the global effect of alterations in acetyl-CoA abundance on the epigenome and preneoplastic cell fate in order to reveal mitochondrial control of acetyl-CoA as a therapeutic vulnerability in this otherwise deadly disease."
HRCS22_15720,Structural basis of B-cell Receptor-mediated cell-autonomous signalling in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,"B cell receptor (BcR) signaling is a central event in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Inhibitors of downstream effectors of BcR signaling display good clinical efficacy, yet have a limited capacity to induce profound clinical responses, and frequently lead to side effects due in part to off-target activity. Thus, the key challenge towards optimal CLL patient management remains the development of tailored treatments that target the BcR-mediated signaling, while taking into account the patient-specific modalities of receptor activation. CLL patients are heterogeneous in leukemic cell phenotype and clinical outcome, but can be grouped in subsets that present homogeneous clinicobiological features based on the expression of highly homologous BcRs. A unique feature of CLL B cells is their ability to signal autonomously in vitro, through homotypic recognition of the BcR. We recently showed that these BcR interactions are different and specific for each subgroup of patients as defined by the receptor structure.  Here, we propose an integrated approach to characterize the structure and self-recognition of BcRs derived from the most common CLL subsets. First, we will determine the high-resolution crystal structures of BcRs from three common stereotyped subsets, as well as non-stereotyped IGHV1-69 receptors. Then, will use mutagenesis and biophysical methods to fully characterize and validate the homotypic binding of the receptors observed in the crystals, and to investigate existing correlations between BcR contacts and clinical course of disease. Finally, we will perform an in silico screening of chemical libraries to identify compounds antagonizing the autologous BcR interaction in the most common CLL cases, and test these in a reconstituted B cell system. The results of the research outlined will widen our knowledge on the mechanism leading to CLL onset, improve patients management, and provide lead compounds against a prevalent form of the disease."
HRCS22_15818,Genetic dissection of factors contributing to disease severity in a fly brain tumour model,"Since the discovery of oncogenes and tumour suppressors, it is known that a small number of genetic insults can transform healthy cells into precancerous. Decades later, we are still trying to fathom the multitude of additional defects that underlie full-blown malignancy. Model organism cancer models with carefully controlled genetic make-up are invaluable in achieving progress in this direction. In the past decade, a number of Drosophila cancer models were developed, that have helped understand aspects of carcinogenesis, such as multiclonality and metastasis. We are studying a cancer model from juvenile fly neural progenitors, which can be immortalized by serial allografting. We have performed transcriptome and histological analysis of this tumour, as well as two genetically defined variants, where we knocked down two key chromatin regulators, the NuRD nucleosome remodeling complex and the PRC2 histone methyltransferase. One of these variants grows more aggressively whereas the other is more benign. From analysis of differentially expressed genes, we have zeroed-in on a number of putative enhancers and suppressors of malignancy; these are the focus of the present proposal. Curiously, a cohort of 15 transcription factors, normally associated with early steps of neuronal differentiation, is upregulated in the more malignant NuRD-compromised variant. At the opposite end, activation of the Toll and JNK pathways is a hallmark of the less malignant PRC2-compromised variant. We propose to perform an in-depth in vivo study of tumours manipulated for these putative modulators in order to determine whether their upregulation causally underlies increased/suppressed malignancy or is simply a collateral effect. In parallel, we shall address the ability of these tumours to induce organ wasting to their hosts: this is more pronounced in the less aggressive tumour. We shall therefore scrutinize its secretome and use genetic manipulations to ask whether one or more tumour-produced cytokines are responsible for host cachexia."
HRCS22_15819,Analysis of somatic recombination in lymphoid cells to unravel DNA end joining regulation in cancer,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are toxic cellular lesions that must be efficiently repaired to maintain genome stability and prevent cancer. The two main DSB repair pathways are homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), with pathway choice partly determined by functional antagonism between the HR-promoting factor BRCA1 and NHEJ-promoting proteins, notably 53BP1/RIF1/MAD2L2. We recently identified two novel genes that encode for previously uncharacterized proteins termed shieldin (SHLD)1 and SHLD2 that form the shieldin complex, which we determined as being the downstream effector of 53BP1/RIF1/MAD2L2 in promoting NHEJ and antagonizing BRCA1-mediated HR. Importantly, loss of SHLD1 or SHLD2 renders poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors ineffective in BRCA1-deficient cancer cells. In addition, we have established that the shieldin complex plays major and distinct roles during antigen receptor gene diversification in lymphocytes, specifically RAG1/2-induced V(D)J recombination and AID-induced class switch recombination (CSR).     In this research program, we propose to utilize programmed DNA recombination processes in lymphocytes to unravel the functions of the 53BP1-MAD2L2-shieldin axis in DSB repair. Specifically, we will analyze at the molecular level the impact of the loss of 53BP1, MAD2L2, and the shieldin complex on recombination intermediates and products. We will also test genetic and functional interactions between NHEJ and the 53BP1-MAD2L2-shieldin axis during V(D)J recombination and CSR. In addition, we will identify the local protein complexes associated with MAD2L2 and SHLD1 upon induction of programmed DSBs. Finally, we will use dedicated genetically modified mouse models to reveal the roles of SHLD1 and SHLD2 in lymphopoiesis.  Ultimately, through these studies, we aim to discover novel modes of regulation of DSB response and repair that could contribute to the development of novel DNA repair based cancer therapies."
HRCS22_15915,Characterizing the role of regulatory T (Treg) cells in the progression of aggressive mesenchymal-type colorectal cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common types of cancer in the Western world and the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality. Analysis of recurrent patterns of gene expression in CRC has led to the identification of four Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS1-4). Of all newly diagnosed CRC cases in the world (1.5 million worldwide), approximately 25% are CMS4 (375,000 new cases each year). CMS4, also known as the ‘mesenchymal subtype’, is characterized by high stromal content and high level TGFß signaling, an increased likelihood of distant metastases, and resistance to chemotherapy and EGFR-targeted therapy. Of all CRC-related deaths worldwide (700,000 per year) approximately 40% is estimated to be due to CMS4 (280,000). Arguably, the development of subtype-targeted therapy is most urgent for CMS4 CRC. We have recently found that CMS4 is characterized by a specific gene signature reflecting infiltration of regulatory T (TREG) cells and have found that mesenchymal-type CRC tumor organoids induce a dramatic increase in TREG cell numbers. This suggests that tumor cells may directly promote TREG cell expansion in CMS4, potentially contributing to local suppression of anti-tumor immunity. Here, a novel in vitro 3D CMS4 tumor organoid-TREG cell co-culture model will be used to determine the capacity of tumor cells to modulate TREG cell development, identity, expansion and phenotype. In parallel, novel in vivo mouse models for CMS4-like metastatic CRC will be utilized to further investigate TREG cell biology, and study the effect of TREG depletion on tumor growth and spontaneous metastasis formation. The enrichment of TREG cells in CMS4 CRC suggests that TREG -targeting therapy may be particularly effective against this subtype. However, more insight into TREG accumulation in CMS4 CRC, their function, and their role in metastasis and therapy resistance needs to be gained, before considering them as valid targets for therapy."
HRCS22_15962,Understanding how clonal hematopoiesis feeds lymphoma,"As the fifth most frequently occurring cancer type in humans, lymphoma still requires to be mechanistically better understood in order to achieve a satisfactory relative survival. A promising approach to close this knowledge gap concerning lymphoma consists in investigating the microenvironment and potentially occurring inflammatory processes, which may have a supportive effect on the emerging and maintenance of tumor progression. Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is the accumulation of mutations in the myeloid-monocyte lineage in healthy individuals. CH has been correlated with inflammation and aging of immune response. One of the most-common mutations in CH is loss-of-function alleles in TET2. TET2 encodes an enzyme involved in epigenetic regulation of hematopoietic cells. Our working hypothesis is that TET2 mutated CH creates an inflamed niche of myeloid cells that support the tumor and/or impair the anti-tumor immune response. Our working hypothesis will be addressed through distinct tasks: 1.) Provide experimental proof that TET2 mutated myeloid cells are enriched in the intra-tumoral microenvironment of lymphoma patients with CH, and that they have a pro-inflammatory/tumor supportive phenotype; 2.) Validating that Tet2–deficient hemopoiesis promotes lymphoma development and 3.) Proofing that TET2 mutated CH is an unfavorable prognostic biomarker in lymphoma. The project leverage state-of-the-art and novel single cell technologies, novel strains of genetically modified mouse models of lymphoma, and clinical trial cohorts. The project will impact on our understanding of lymphoma biology and will create a new platform for therapeutic advances in this tumor. In terms of knowledge, we will discover a completely new and actionable mechanism of lymphoma promotion that may be termed as “monoclonal immune microenvironment” that will advance the understanding of the interplay between immune-aging and tumor development. In terms of treatment, we will generate both reagents and candidate targets from pre-clinical studies aiming at re-educating or eradicating the “monoclonal immune microenvironment”."
HRCS22_15987,Exploring the functional role of EZH2-dependent autocrine signaling in T-cell leukemia,"BACKGROUND: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) is a malignancy with refractory/relapsed cases, presumably due to the ineffective targeting of leukemia initiating cells (LICs). DNA mutations, leading to the hyperactivation of Notch1 signaling, are found in >50% of human T-ALL. NOTCH1 binding induces the eviction of PRC2, which promotes the repressive H3K27me3 chromatin modification. Moreover, we observed that in NOTCH1-induced mouse T-cell leukemias, the shRNA-mediated knockdown of EZH2 (a functional component of PRC2) stimulates cell growth/survival by inducing an autocrine IGF-like signaling, critical for LIC activity.  OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: This proposal intends to characterize the functional role of EZH2 in the NOTCH1-driven malignant transformation of human cells and to define the EZH2-dependent autocrine signaling involved in T-ALL pathogenesis. We hypothesize that the silencing of EZH2 modulates functional pathways of T-cell transformation and LIC activity underlying the different outcomes of relapsed/recurrent leukemias.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Determine whether the loss of EZH2 promotes the malignant transformation of hematopoietic stem/progenitors(HSPCs) from human cord blood; Characterize the EZH2-dependent autocrine signaling in human NOTCH1-induced HSPCs; Define the functional role of EZH2 in the LIC activity of human T-ALL.     STUDY DESIGN: We propose to use novel models of human T-ALL in which HSPCs from cord blood are transformed into clonal T-ALL-like malignant cells, after transduction with lentiviral vectors encoding NOTCH1-ΔE (a constitutively active NOTCH1 variant) alone or in combination with three known T-ALL oncogenes, and subsequent injection into immunocompromised mice. We will perform gain/loss-of-function assays to assess the EZH2 contribution to leukemogenesis and LIC-related phenotypes. We will employ ELISA/Luminex analyses, combined with RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq and TaqMan gene expression assays for characterizing the EZH2-dependent autocrine signaling. Conventional EZH2 inhibitors and patient-derived xenograft(PDX) leukemias will be also included.  SIGNIFICANCE: This study will outline relevant pathways of leukemia maintenance, development and chemoresistance and provide rationale for drug design by identifying novel molecular targets."
HRCS22_15995,Role of PI3K-C2G in pancreatic cancer metabolism,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the most lethal cancer across the world, with incidence equaling mortality. Recently, PC emerged as a metabolic outlier characterized by several metabolic dependencies, representing an unmet opportunity for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. A wealth of studies report that enhanced activation of PI3K/mTOR pathway has a critical role in the pathogenesis of PC and it is required for sustaining malignant growth and metabolism rewiring. The mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) is a key regulator of metabolic adaptation to nutrient availability, promoting anabolic pathways. Recently, it has been reported that PI(3,4)P2, a class II PI3K signaling product, can act as a local repressor of the mTORC1 signaling. Differently from other class II members which are ubiquitous, In particular, the PI3K-C2γ isoform is mainly expressed in the pancreatic tissue where it plays a pivotal role in cell metabolism. In human PDAC, the PIK3C2G gene is homozygous-deleted in about 7% of patients. Therefore, we decided to model PI3K-C2γ loss (PIK3C2G gene KO) in a mouse model of PC (KPC). We found that lack of PI3K-Cϒ increases tumor development and progression, strongly reducing mice mean survival rate and driving rapid progression to cancer. Biochemical analyses of PIK3C2G-deficient tumors revealed a specific hyperactivation of mTORC1 pathway, increasing metabolic alterations. To consolidate these findings, we aim at: i) assessing the oncogenic potential of PI3K-C2ϒ ii) dissecting PI3K-C2ϒ signaling pathway iii) exploiting metabolic dependencies of PI3K-C2ϒ loss iv) defining the prognostic and predictive value of PI3K-C2ϒ in PDAC. With this project, we expect to validate PI3K-C2ϒ as a novel tumor suppressor in PC and to establish a new mechanism by which PI3K-C2ϒ controls metabolic alterations induced by mTORC1 hyperactivation. Eventually, data obtained from this study will validate selective inhibition of critical metabolic pathways in PI3K-C2ϒ-deficient tumors to maximize therapeutic success."
HRCS22_16007,Uncovering the regulation of chromatin structure by TET2 during leukemic cell fate decisions,"Cytosine methylation at CpG dinucleotides is the major epigenetic modification of mammalian DNA and plays important roles during relevant processes of cell fate decisions including embryo development and cancer. Cell fate decisions, such as during normal or malignant differentiation, are typically initiated by transcription factors (TFs) that regulate gene expression in concert with epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation. Loss of this DNA modification can be either passive or active when initiated by TET enzymes. Of the three TET enzymes described, TET2 seems to be the family member most important for induced cell fate changes.In addition,TET2 is among the most frequently mutated genes in blood cancers (7-50% of patients depending on the type of cancer) and its mutations typically trigger aberrant gene expression profiles eventually leading to the onset of haematological diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms by which aberrant TET2 activity rewires the normal gene expression profile into a tumorigenic one is still poorly understood.   To decipher these molecular mechanisms, I propose to use a unique cell fate conversion system consisting in the C/EBPa-induced transdifferentiation of human leukemic B cells into non-tumorigenic macrophages at nearly 100% efficiency. This system is therefore ideally suited to study how TFs orchestrate DNA methylation changes in concert with TET2 to induce the observed loss of tumorigenicity. In addition, the system recapitulates the leukemic progression (in a reverse fashion) offering a unique opportunity to unveil the really first chromatin events at the onset of the disease. Consequently, results from this study will be highly relevant for the understanding of the role of DNA methylation in blood cancer initiation and progression and might shed light on potential new targets for patients suffering from acute mieloid leukemia."
HRCS22_16034,Decoding the role of lipids in the metabolic control of CD8+ T cells by the gut microbiota to improve outcomes in colorectal cancer.,"Over a third of resected early-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) relapse and patients die from metastatic disease. Infiltrating lymphocytes are independent positive predictor of survival in CRC, however only a small fraction of patients respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). This project originates from two milestone discoveries. First, the gut microbiome modulates response to ICI, but the overlap across different cohorts is mostly functional rather than compositional. Second, accumulation of specific lipids in the tumor microenvironment (TME) impact the anti-tumor activity of CD8+ T cells. We have conducted comprehensive metagenomic, metabolomic and immune characterization on CRC patients, observing parallel changes in mucosa and tissues. Thus, we hypothesize that therapeutic manipulation of the metabolic output of mucosal bacteria can reshape the TME and improve the response of CRC to ICI. This prospective study is designed to: . DECODE the interplay between metabolic activities in the intestinal mucosa and immune cell functions on CRC patients; . VALIDATE the effect of lipids derived or induced by bacteria on immune cell functions; . TRANSLATE new knowledge into innovative strategies to improve ICI efficacy. Main objectives are: . Quantification of lipids and reconstruction of bacteria-host metabolic pathways, in tumours and surrounding tissues; . Characterization of the immunomodulatory impact of the microbiota on CD8+ T cells; . Mechanistic validation and improvement of ICI’s response on a novel patient-derived organ-on-chip device. This study will enable multi-scale profiling and predictive modelling on a fully annotated cohort while simultaneously spawning novel actionable targets for therapy. Tumour sensitivity to ICI will be tested, providing initial experimental validation on a patient-relevant and cost-effective system. Data generated through this project may also reconcile the limited association between the overall composition of the microbiome and the response to immunotherapy across different cohorts of patients, a crucial step toward new stratification strategies and therapeutic approaches."
HRCS22_16036,Investigating the roles of NF-κB subunits as master regulators of CD8+ T-cell function in cancer immunity and immunotherapy.,"Cancer progression is greatly influenced by a delicate balance between tolerance to and immune response against tumors. The recent success of immunotherapies such as checkpoint-blockade therapies, demonstrates that this balance can be shifted effectively towards enhanced anti-tumor immunity, to delay or even stop cancer progression, particularly by enhancing the function of CD8+ T cells. However, only a fraction a patients respond to these regimens, and the molecular mechanisms that drive the response and resistance to immunotherapies are largely unknown. The transcription factor NF-kappaB (NF-kB) has been implicated in the regulation of T-cell function. However NF-kB is in fact a family of transcription factors composed of 5 distinct subunits; due to the lack of suitable tools, the contribution of individual subunits of NF-kB to CD8+ T-cell biology has never been addressed. In this application, we propose to investigate the exact roles of NF-kB subunits that control CD8+ T-cell function in cancer immunity. We will use unique mouse models carrying ablation of NF-kB subunits specifically in mature CD8+ T cells, CRISPR-based gene edition in primary human cells and high-throughput sequencing analyses. Based on our previous publications and preliminary data, we hypothesize that the activation of selective NF-kB subunits orchestrates CD8+ T-cell biology and underlies the clinical response to checkpoint-blockade therapies. Importantly, these studies may reveal specific NF-kB subunit activities that can be targeted by novel therapeutics to enhance T-cell function alone or in concert with existing immunotherapies."
HRCS22_16064,Identifying properties of tumour suppressive pericytes for cancer therapy (PERISUPPRESS),"Non-transformed co-habitant cells, defined as stroma, play key roles in the development and progression of tumours. Thus, understanding their function is instrumental for the efficacious eradication of the disease. Taking advantage of computational analyses, a unique collection of prostate cancer (PCa) mouse models, and our know-how expertise in pericyte biology, we have identified that pericytes inform about PCa recurrence and metastasis. Here, we postulate that the study of molecular cues governing the pericyte-cancer cell relationship provides an innovative perspective of the aggressive properties of cancer cells. This may serve to define therapeutic strategies that would be missed in a classical tumour cell-centred discovery approach. PERISUPRESS aims to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms which promote tumour suppressive properties in pericytes by: (1) a discovery approach to identify pericyte-related molecular cues associated with PCa progression; (2) the study of the impact of pericyte-specific molecular programs on PCa progression; (3) the identification of pericyte-related vulnerabilities associated to PCa progression.  This will be done through awell-balanced experimental plan which includes mouse models and patient-derived samples from PCa at different disease grades, computational biology and multiple in vitro and in vivo functional and mechanistic approaches. In summary, the study of pericyte biology in PCa has the potential to open a new window in the comprehension and treatment of aggressive PCa that may also be applied to other types of cancer."
HRCS22_16094,Unravelling the requirement of Rad18 in glioblastoma proliferation,"Glioblastoma is the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumor characterized by a strong resistance to therapy involving treatment with ionizing radiations and alkylating agents. The molecular grounds of this acquired resistance are currently unknown. The identification of novel therapeutic targets constitutes therefore a priority. We and others have recently reported an implication of the Rad18 (E3) ubiquitin ligase in the resistance of glioblastoma to cisplatin and ionizing radiations. Rad18, a critical component of DNA damage bypass, activates translesion synthesis by catalyzing the transfer of an ubiquitin monomer on PCNA, a well-known proliferation-associated antigen. This results in recruitment of translesion synthesis DNA polymerases to allow DNA synthesis through DNA lesions thus facilitating escape of apoptosis and contributing in resistance to therapy. In addition, Rad18 is also implicated in repair of single and double DNA strand breaks as those generated by the radiotherapy. Unexpectedly, by analyzing the phenotypes associated with Rad18 downregulation in glioblastoma, we have observed that Rad18, which is non-essential for life, is essential for the proliferation of glioblastoma cells, and in particular of glioblastoma cancer stem cells (GCSCs), those cells currently strongly implicated in the resistance to the therapy. The aim of this work is to unveil the specific function of Rad18 in the proliferation of GCSCs and to propose Rad18 as novel therapeutic target in the treatment of glioblastoma. This will be achieved thought the identification of the molecular pathway(s) in which Rad18 is implicated through genome-wide analysis of genes and proteins affected by Rad18 expression, as well as by the identification of Rad18 substrates in GCSCs. We will also generate a proof-of-concept for a role of Rad18 in sustaining glioblastoma proiliferation in preclinical models using both wild-type and Rad18 knock-out mice."
HRCS22_16120,Defining NRF2-independent ROS management as bottleneck to tumor initiation,"Cancer is generally viewed as a genetic disease, which develops when cells acquire mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors. These mutations are thought to progressively derail tissue homeostasis, allowing for an expansion of tumorigenic clones with unlimited proliferative potential that fuels long-term tumor growth. Surprisingly, recent mutational analyses of physiologically normal skins unveiled a mutational spectrum and burden that is similar to what had been reported for squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Additionally, intravital imaging revealed that skin epithelial progenitor cells (EPCs) with oncogenic mutations persist only transiently and are primarily outcompeted by normal EPCs. These observations, along with stereotypic transcriptional and metabolic changes, which distinguish tumor propagating SCC cells (TPCs) from normal EPCs, suggest that epigenetic adaptation is critical for tumor initiation and persistent expansion. Still, the mechanisms facilitating this epigenetic and metabolic rewiring are largely unknown. Here, we will test the hypothesis that de novo Paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1 (PITX1) expression facilitates the epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of KrasG12Dmutant EPC into TPCs. PITX1 dependent changes in chromatin accessibility will enhance self-renewal and increase cell survival by reducing Ras generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). Specifically, we will (1.) determine how PITX1 cooperates with KrasG12Das they reprogram the transposase accessible open chromatin of homeostatic EPCs into the TPC specific epigenetic landscape; (2.) measure how these changes in chromatin accessibility influence ROS management; and (3.) determine if PITX1 dependent antioxidant production is a rate limiting step for tumor initiation. The results of our proposed research are expected to illuminate how oncogenic stress co-operates with sequence specific transcription factors to epigenetically rewire a homeostatic state into a tumorigenic epigenome, which allows TPCs to meet the metabolic demands required for tumor expansion. Once identified, these mechanisms could improve the early diagnosis and prevention of this exceedingly common and deadly human cancer."
HRCS22_16127,Characterising the role of RET in breast cancer brain metastasis as a facilitator of colonisation and a novel targeted therapy,"Brain metastasis occurs in 10-30% of breast cancer patients and is fast becoming the foremost clinical challenge in the management of metastatic disease. Limited therapeutic options exist for patients with brain metastasis and the current treatment paradigm consists of surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery and whole-brain radiation. Clearly, there is an urgent need to better understand the mechanisms of breast cancer metastasis to the brain and to define novel therapeutic targets. Recent comprehensive sequencing studies from our group and collaborators have revealed a number of brain metastasis enriched oncogenic alterations with potential clinical significance.  Aims: We aim to determine whether altered aberrant RET signalling in metastatic breast cancer is a key mediator of tumour colonisation of the brain. We also aim to determine the efficacy of RET inhibition to abolish cell growth and survival of breast cancer brain metastatic cells.  Technique and Methodology: To address the suitability of RET as a target we will use both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of RET in comprehensive in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo pre-clinical models of breast cancer brain metastasis representing all three clinical subtypes. In vitro experiments will be accompanied by functional interrogation while in vivo experiments will be complemented by next-generation sequencing of the brain invading tumours.  Impact on breast cancer research: The outcomes of this project have the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of the oncogenic significance of recurrent, acquired aberrations in the RET pathway in breast cancer brain metastasis. This project has the potential to uncover the clinical utility of brain metastasis-acquired clinically actionable alterations that could lay the foundations for a clinical trial utilising RET inhibition for patients with breast cancer brain metastasis."
HRCS22_16166,Notch3 as a regulator of cancer-associated fibroblast reprogramming and functions in intestinal cancer,"The Notch signaling pathway plays an important role in development, homeostasis, and disease, such as cancer, where its therapeutic potential is under consideration. However, the role of individual receptors, their cell-specific functions, and their implication in cancer therapy is not yet fully understood. Notch3 is of particular interest, as it is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and associated with worst prognosis. Our preliminary data suggest that in patients and animal models of CRC, Notch3 is predominantly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and more specifically in intratumoral perivascular fibroblasts. However, the mechanisms driving Notch3 activation in fibroblasts and its role as a regulator of CAF reprogramming and downstream functions are not known. In this proposal, we bring forward the hypothesis that endothelial-specific Notch ligands can activate Notch3 signaling in adjacent perivascular fibroblasts, leading to their activation and downstream functions associated with either or both angiogenesis and cancer cell proliferation, ultimately leading to tumor growth. Notch3 inhibition could thus have a therapeutic effect either alone or in combination with standard therapy. To address this hypothesis, we will combine in vitro and in vivo genetic targeting, 2D and 3D cell co-culture techniques, high-throughput single-cell, and bulk RNA sequencing, and mouse models of disease. We expect that this study could lead to a better understanding of the role of fibroblast-specific Notch3 in CRC and the potential of its inhibition in the clinic. In addition, it will provide further insight into the mechanisms driving CAF reprogramming and functions and thus help identify novel targets for therapeutic approaches, as well as diagnosis and patient stratification."
HRCS22_16200,Uncovering the effects of DNA replication stress on cell fate determination in cancer and stem cells.,"Several studies have indicated that most cancer cells are associated with stress caused by the perturbation of DNA replication inducing replication stress (RS). RS and in general genome instability are major causes of genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity in human tumors. However, despite this heterogeneity, tumor mass and metastasis display stereotypical behaviors that allow them to invade surrounding tissues and escape immune surveillance. These features are remarkably similar to the ones displayed by trophoblast cells supporting placenta development. Using mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) we have recently found that RS-mediated activation of ATR and CHK1 promotes the expression of thousands of genes many of which involved in trophoblast differentiation, suggesting that RS can impact on cell fate determination in stem cells. The activation of several of these genes is coordinated by DUX, the master regulator of the two-cell stage in mouse ESCs, which we showed to be required for multinucleated trophoblast giant cells differentiation in response to RS. DUX and its human ortholog DUX4 are suppressed in normal adult cells. However, they are specifically reactivated in tumors where they promote the emergence of trophoblast-like features. Here we will study the molecular mechanisms linking RS to trophoblast activation in ESCs, identify pathways shared between placenta and cancer cells and uncover the mechanisms that suppress placenta activating mechanisms in adult somatic cells. Our studies will set the stage for targeting these pathways in order to develop new and effective therapeutic strategies to eradicate tumors."
HRCS22_16209,Targeting TFEB transcription factor as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of Birt-Hogg-Dube’- associated kidney cancer,"Birt-Hogg-Dube’ is a hereditary cancer syndrome, due to loss of function mutations in the gene encoding Folliculin and characterized by benign skin tumors, lung and kidney cysts and renal cell carcinoma. Renal tumors represent the most severe manifestation of the disease and to date surgery is the only available therapeutic intervention. The design of effective targeted therapies depend on a better understanding of the primary cellular pathways in which folliculin serves as tumor suppressor. We recently found that depletion of TFEB in a kidney-specific mouse model of BHD syndrome fully rescued cystogenesis suggesting a key role of TFEB in Folliculin dependent pathologies. Encouraged by these findings, in this grant application we propose to understand the contribute of TFEB to the development of kidney tumors in Flcn heterozygous mice, which faithfully recapitulate kidney pathologies in BHD disease. In addition, we aimed at dissecting the TFEB downstream pathways responsible for tumor growth in BHD patients and functionally characterize a novel mechanism of regulation of TFEB localization, which could represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of BHD renal tumors."
HRCS22_16334,Chromatin organization and transcription factor targeting in the establishment of oncogene-induced senescence and cancer progression.,"Background. Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) acts as a powerful tumor suppressive mechanism by inducing quasi-irreversible cell-cycle arrest when cells experience oncogenic stress. Senescent cells, however, can still overcome OIS leading to cancer onset.  Senescence is caused by persistent DNA damage and it is characterized by massive chromatin reorganization and altered gene expression profiles, including the establishment of SASP, an inflammatory transcriptional program. Senescence can propagate to bystander cells, due to SASP-dependent paracrine and SASP-independent juxtacrine mechanisms. Key transcription factors (TFs) such as p53 and NF-kB mediate these processes but how chromatin impacts their activation and binding dynamics in OIS, in bystander senescence (BySen) and upon senescence overcome (SenOv) has been only marginally explored.  Objective. We will test an uncharted hypothesis on early tumorigenesis: the massive chromatin reorganization observed upon OIS induction shape the search mechanism and the activity of the key TFs implicated in OIS, BySen and SenOv. To this end, we will integrate genomic technologies with unique microscopy approaches that we developed to probe TF activity at the single-cell and single-molecule level.  Experimental Plan. We will model OIS – by oncogene induction - and SenOv – by histone demethylases overexpression - in human fibroblasts and melanocytes. We will analyze chromatin reorganization, TFs binding, and target gene expression in single cells using super-resolution and single-molecule microscopy to answer these questions: Does chromatin reorganization in OIS control the capability of TFs to find, bind and activate their targets? How does the further chromatin remodeling in BySen and SenOv affect TFs activity? How do paracrine signaling in modulate chromatin organization and TFs action?  Significance. We will picture with single-cell resolution the interplay between chromatin architecture, TFs activity and paracrine signaling in a tumorigenesis model, leading to fundamental insights about early cancer progression that could be translated into the identification of novel druggable targets."
HRCS22_16398,"Ultra-Sensitive, Switchable MRI Reporters for Lung Metastases","Early cancer detection and visualisation of disease progression are highly relevant for succesful therapy. Imaging reporters for minimally invasive methods such as MRI are thus an indispensable component and visualising information of the biological complexity of tumour tissue beecomes increasingly important for choosing the right therapy. This is particularly relevant for metastatses detection which is a central aspect of diagnostic imaging. MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast but suffers from low sensitivity, particularly in the lung which is low in tissue water density but is the most common organ targeted by metastases. MRI reporters with molecular spcificity for metastaes are therefore highly needed but cannot be implemented with conventional detection.  Here we address this problem with an imaging method that includes a pre-targeting approach for LHRH receptor-carrying metastases and subsequent detection through-spin hyperpolarised xenon. The enhanced magnetization of this noble gas together with a saturation transfer technique from the molecular reporter onto the gas will enable ca. 10 million-fold enhanced sensitivity. We will design ""smart"" nanoparticles that selectively highlight the signal of xenon that has been in contact with these reporters that carry luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) for specific binding to cancer cells. This approach shall visualize pulmonary micrometastates from breast cancer cells. The method serves as an example for a molecular target from which a platform can be developped for different tumour markers. The combination of novel techniques from MRI physics and bioengineering will provide ""switchable"" MRI agents with a specific MR response frequency for xenon through the metastases-bound reporters and will bring diagnostic lung imaging to an uprecedented sensitivity level. A versatile design respects the need for easy adaptation to implement personalized diagnostics to interrogate the presence of various molecular targets."
HRCS22_16421,Determinants of EML4-ALK Driven Lung Cancer Growth and Therapeutic Responses,"Lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) in non-smokers often harbour specific genetic aberrations, such as gene fusions involving the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) and the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4). This oncogenic fusion has been reported to have 15 different variants, which harbour the same ALK sequence but differ in the EML4 breakpoint. Variant 1 and variant 3 differ greatly in the proportion of EML4 and are two most frequent oncogenic inversion in ALK-positive patients. Despite the development of second-and third-generation ALK inhibitors, patient responses are limited by drug resistance. In half of relapsed cases, resistance arises from secondary mutations in the TK domain; however, the mechanisms of resistance in patients lacking secondary mutations remain poorly characterized. Besides, the impact of concurrent genomic alterations in EML4-ALK driven tumours remains largely unknown. TP53 is mutated in 30% of ALK-rearranged LUAD and appears to be synergistic with variant 3, giving rise to more aggressive human disease. Despite the direct relevance to patient treatment, how these co-incident genomic alterations influence the robustness of therapeutic responses has never been investigated. Here we propose to employ state-of-the-art technologies and methodologies to model Eml4-Alk variants in vivo and study the tumour evolution and dynamics of the most aggressive variants (Aim1). In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of co-incident genomic alterations on EML4-ALK-driven lung cancer development, by inactivating putative tumour suppressor genes in a variant-specific manner. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the impact of different Eml4-Alk variants and concomitant genomic alterations on response to ALK inhibition. By combining multiplex genome editing with drug treatment, we will perform the equivalent of hundreds of genotype-directed clinical trials in parallel and therefore this project will have a direct impact on personalised treatment for patients with EML4-ALK lung tumours."
HRCS22_16429,Oncogene discovery in esophageal cancer through interrogation of 3D regulatory landscapes,"Esophageal cancer is one of the most common and lethal cancers worldwide, yet currently no targeted therapeutics exists for its treatment. A critical roadblock in the development of targeted therapeutics for esophageal cancer is the lack of knowledge of the key oncogenic drivers in this cancer and the regulatory landscape that controls the expression of those genes. For example, genome-sequencing efforts of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), the most frequent subtype of esophageal cancer, have revealed few frequently mutated genes to date, and those mutations have limited prognostic benefit, which suggests that mutations in non-coding DNA may play critical roles in EAC development. Gene expression programs are implemented in the three dimensional context of 3D chromosome structures, and our previous work suggests that the boundary elements of such 3D chromosome neighborhoods are frequently mutated in EAC. In this work, we propose to generate maps of the 3D regulatory landscape for multiple esophageal adenocarcinoma cells for the discovery of new oncogenic drivers. We will combine the 3D regulatory maps with whole genome sequence information to create a compressive catalog of candidate EAC driver mutations that occur in non-coding DNA elements, including chromosome neighborhood boundaries, and will use the 3D regulatory landscapes to identify oncogenes dysregulated around the mutated neighborhoods. We will functionally validate the candidate driver mutations and the new candidate oncogenes in cell line- and organoid models and using clinical information. This work will generate a functionally validated set of EAC oncogenes whose genomic sequence is otherwise intact. Results of this work will provide insights into the clinical utility of mutations disrupting chromosome neighborhoods in EAC, and facilitate the development and application of new therapeutic approaches for this common and deadly cancer."
HRCS22_16434,Mechanisms of resistance to anti-TGF-beta therapies in metastatic colorectal cancer,"Most colorectal cancer (CRC) patients die as a result of metastasis. Neither conventional chemotherapy nor current targeted therapies offer significant benefits once the disease has spread to distant organs. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown efficacy in only a small subset of patients bearing hypermutated CRCs. Arguably, these failures result from the incomplete understanding of metastatic CRC, which is in part due to lack of mouse models that recapitulate the advanced stages of the disease. We permuted conditional alleles of the WNT, EGFR, TGF-beta and p53 pathways in intestinal stem cells of mice. Quadruple mutant mice developed metastatic human-like intestinal adenocarcinomas. These tumors display key hallmarks of aggressive CRCs including T cell exclusion and a TGF-beta activated stroma. From these genetic mouse models we derived mouse tumor organoids (MTOs), which upon transplantation in immunocompetent recipients recreated both the primary and metastatic disease. Analysis of metastasis generated by MTOs revealed that tumor cells build an immunoprivileged microenvironment during liver colonization, by promoting T-cell exclusion and blocking the acquisition of a Th1 effector phenotype. Inhibition of TGF-beta signaling reverts this process and unleashes a potent cytotoxic T-cell response against tumor cells, which is long lasting and protects mice from metastatic disease. In mice with progressed liver metastatic disease, blockade of TGF-beta signaling rendered tumors susceptible to anti-PD-1/PD-L1checkpoint therapy. As poor prognosis CRCs are characterized by high levels of TGF-beta and immune evasion, our findings suggest that TGF-beta signaling inhibitors may have broad applications to treat patients with advanced CRC. However, we have discovered that a subset of mouse CRCs develop resistance to TGF-beta-based therapies during metastatic outgrowth. Here we propose to investigate this process and identify the mechanism co-opted by resistant CRCs to evade the action of the adaptive immune system triggered by treatment with TGF-beta inhibitors."
HRCS22_16441,International integrated analysis to identify markers of poor survival in high-risk neuroblastoma,"The outcome for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma is currently inadequate despite intensive multimodal therapy and despite continued treatment intensification (such as the addition of immunotherapy or tandem high-dose chemotherapy). To date, most patients with high-risk are treated in a broadly similar manner.   Many researchers have looked at biomarkers (biological characteristics) that could identify those patients with the poorest outcome right from the time of diagnosis, so that these patients could be offered novel therapies very early in their disease course. So far, despite hundreds of studies evaluating factors routinely used in the clinic (such as age or number of metastasis) or more advanced technologies including complex genomic analyses, none of these biomarkers has been validated nor is available for clinical-decision making.   The novelty of our approach is that we aim to integrate all (or as many as possible) biomarkers that have been described to date, pull together all the data, and analyse and compare all biomarkers head to head in the same dataset.   We will do this in three phases: First, we will look at all published literature about neuroblastoma biomarkers from 1995 onwards and conduct a thorough analysis (this is called a systematic review and meta-analysis) to select the best biomarkers reported to date. Second, we will gain access to patient databases for each of the biomarkers (at the moment, each biomarker has been evaluated in a separate study/dataset) and create an enlarged INRG database including as many datasets, variables and biomarkers as possible; to then conduct an analysis integrating all the data together, which is called multivariate analysis. Thirdly, in order to confirm which biomarker(s) found on the first two phases are definitely the best one(s), we will analyse the best performing biomarkers in a homogeneous cohort of patients treated within a contemporaneous clinical trial, i.e. repeating all biomarkers in the same patients (which has never been done), to confirm which one(s) perform better and is taken forward to make treatment decisions in real clinical practice.   With this ambitious approach, our proposal aims to identify patients with high-risk neuroblastoma with the poorest outcome at the time of diagnosis, with the final aim of giving these patients access to early therapies upfront, without waiting for them to relapse or become refractory to treatment."
HRCS22_16445,Resolving the tumour suppressor function of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin,"The E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin is critical for maintaining mitochondrial quality control as it is the key effector in damage-induced mitophagy. As well as a have key role in early onset Parkinson’s disease, Parkin is emerging as an important tumour suppressor, with mounting evidence indicating that the gene encoding Parkin (PRKN/PARK2) is one of the most frequently deleted or mutated genes in a wide variety of cancers including glioblastoma, colorectal, breast cancer. We have also identified links between Parkin loss and neuroblastoma, a common childhood cancer with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. How Parkin limits the growth of such diverse tumours is unclear. We hypothesise that the ability of Parkin to limit inflammation promoted by damaged mitochondria underpins its tumour suppressor function. We will use complementary cell and new mouse models coupled with innovative proteomics analyses to resolve how the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin controls inflammation as well as critical processes including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation and metabolism to define how Parkin activity limits the development of neuroblastoma. This proposal will identify Parkin or its specific substrates as new targets to treat neuroblastoma and potentially other cancers."
HRCS22_16463,How can we harness cancer mechanobiology to prevent tumour progression?,"Metastatic breast cancer is currently incurable and new methods to halt invasion and metastasis are an important unmet clinical need. Rho-ROCK signalling in tumour cells is a key arbiter of the paracrine program by which cancers shape their microenvironments. We have established using an in vivo model of mammary cancer, that two key proteins, Creld2 and Ptx3 secreted by progressive breast cancers of all subtypes, mediate the recruitment and polarisation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs). Crucially, these genetically normal cells are brought into the tumour's influence to promote tumour progression. We hypothesise that specific effector pathways downstream of ROCK synergise with tumour mechanobiology to selectively mediate the production and secretion of these paracrine factors. Identifying crucial signalling nodes within these pathways may prove a fertile source of novel approaches to target cancer progression. These studies complement ongoing research to identify the receptors in CAFs and TAMs that mediate the functions of Creld2 and Ptx3.  Here we plan to:  1. Employ an in vivo model of microenvironment education and multiplex immunolabelling approaches to characterise the molecular mechanisms underlying the production and secretion of Ptx3  2. Adapt ex vivo primary cell culture approaches and in vivo functional assays to assess the contributions of ECM stiffness and the tumour secretome to the production of tumour-promoting CAFs and TAMs  3. Employ an alginate-based ex vivo 3D culture system to establish the biological relevance of CRELD2 and PTX3 to the tumour microenvironment of human patient samples.  We believe that this highly innovative approach to understanding the interplay between signalling and mechanobiology in the tumour microenvironment will allow us to identify novel vulnerabilities that permit the targeting of breast and other cancers."
HRCS22_16520,Making vital connections; exploring how desmoplasia gets on pancreatic cancer's nerves,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) will soon become the second USA deadliest neoplasia.  PDAC features a fibrous stroma, desmoplasia, with low blood/nutritional supply and extensive innervation (neoneurogenesis/axonogenesis) associated with poor prognosis, neuropathy and perineural invasion.  The roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their self-derived desmoplastic extracellular matrix (D-ECM), in aiding nutritional-deprived tumor survival and neoneurogenesis, which affect PDAC’s onset/progression, are understudied.  Using mRNA from patient’s D-ECM producing CAFs vs. matching normal stellate cells, we discovered a specific glutamatergic presynaptic protein.  A simultaneous multiplex immunofluorescent approach validated its overexpression and that of its postsynaptic partner.  Increased expression of these proteins is typical in neurological syndromes allied to increased cancer risk.  Preliminary data indicated that: D-ECM and CAFs increase both neuron and tumor cell longevity; functional synapses between CAF and other cells are formed; and, CAF-secreted vesicles expressing presynaptic protein engage with PDAC cells, expressing the postsynaptic protein to promote tumor growth.  Hypothesis: PDAC is locally enabled by D-ECM, CAFs, neurons and CAF secreted vesicles in a synapse-like mechanism.  Aim1: Investigate if CAFs support neoneurogenesis and PDAC cells in a synapse-like manner.  We will test the functional need for CAF and neural synaptic proteins, as well as downstream enzymes and other proteins, in maintaining high extracellular glutamate levels, posited to sustain neoneurogenesis and PDAC survival under nutritional stress.  Our D-ECM system together with gain and loss of function approaches will be used to investigate the synaptic protein roles in these processes.  Aim2: Assess requirement for and level of “pre- and post-synaptic” proteins linked to human PDAC.  We will use our multiplex immunofluorescent approach in a well annotated human PDAC cohort to question neoneurogenesis levels associated with quantities and locations of the synaptic pair and question their association with patient outcomes.  Vesicles, positive for the pre-synaptic protein, will be probed in matching liquid biopsies."
HRCS22_16528,Understanding the immune cell dysfunction in pediatric lymphoma,"Lymphoma is the third most common type of cancer among children and accounts for 10-15% of all childhood cancers. Lymphoma in children and adults are divided into three main groups; Hodgkin lymphoma, B- and T-cell lymphoma. Lymphoma stems from faulty activation of B cells and, less frequently, T cells. Upon an infection, B cells undergo affinity maturation in germinal centers. B cells in germinal centers mutate their antibody-coding genes in a process that induce DNA damage during rapid B cell proliferation. B cell transformation into lymphoma may occur because of faulty DNA repair, defects in cell division, and impaired migration and interaction with other cells during the process of mutating and selecting the best fit B cells for antibody production. Patients with inborn errors in the immune system, primary immunodeficiency diseases, are prone to develop pediatric and adolescent lymphoma of very poor prognosis. An unmet need is to understand the molecular and cellular pathophysiology to define better treatment for patients with pediatric lymphoma, both in the primary and relapse setting, and for poor prognosis lymphoma of primary immunodeficiency patients. The goal of this project is two-fold: 1) To gain molecular insight into pediatric lymphoma by analysis of single cells from lymphoma specimens and 2) To develop and use methods where specific alteration in gene expression can be examined functionally and for defining new personalized and generalized therapeutic approaches."
HRCS22_16545,Understanding oncogenic transcriptional processes in synovial sarcoma,"Synovial sarcoma is an often aggressive malignancy primarily effecting children and young adults. Unfortunately, these tumours often do not respond well to conventional therapeutic interventions and overall survival rates remain poor. The disease is caused by a recurrent chromosomal translocation generating a characteristic fusion protein, SS18-SSX. In synovial sarcoma cells the fusion protein assembles into SWI/SNF complexes, which are essential chromatin regulators that alter chromatin structure to regulate gene expression. Incorporation of SS18-SSX into these complexes alters their function, resulting in significant oncogenic gene expression changes. Targeting the oncogenic function of SS18-SSX presents and attractive therapeutic option for the development of mechanistically anchored cancer treatments; however the fusion itself has proven intractable for direct targeting. Here, we are pursuing a research program aimed at better understanding the function of SS18-SSX containing complexes and exploring new opportunities to therapeutically target complexes containing the fusion protein. Using CRISPR/Cas9 based approaches in functional genomics screening we’ve identified the acetyltransferase enzyme p300 as functionally essential in synovial sarcoma cells. By combining these data with in depth proteomic analyses of SS18-SSX interacting proteins we further identified that p300 physically associates with SS18-SSX. In Aims 1 and 2 of this research program we are combining biochemical and genomics approaches to characterise the composition and function of SS18-SSX/p300 containing complexes in synovial sarcoma cells. In Aim 3 we are taking an ambitious approach combining CRISPR/Cas9 screening with single-cell genomics analysis platforms to characterise the molecular function of SS18-SSX containing complexes in cancer cells. Together, these aims will provide a mechanistic understanding and potential therapeutic rationale for targeting p300 function as a novel therapy in patients. In addition to providing unprecedented molecular understanding of disease biology, which will likely highlight more opportunities to explore and develop future approaches to more effectively treat synovial sarcoma patients."
HRCS22_16556,Hysteresis conveys the EMT spread to the neighborhood tumor cells and metastasis,"Cancer metastasis is a complex process with multiple challenges that disseminated tumour cells need to overcome to form overt metastasis, yet many biological aspects of metastasis are poorly understood. One of the most studied tumour cell phenotypic changes during metastasis is the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This is a reversible transdifferentiation into a mesenchymal phenotype that favours cancer cell dissemination and cell plasticity to adapt to new conditions. We have recently described the dynamics of EMT at single cell level, by a molecular feedback loop that governs a bistable switch among the epithelial and mesenchymal state, also called hysteresis. However, how the dynamics affects group-decision processes at the cell population level has not been yet well studied. Remarkably, our recent data in 2D cell cultures show that EMT-like cells can spatially spread the EMT induction to the neighbourhood when the recipient cells are wired to undergo EMT by hysteresis. In this proposal, we aim to study the collective effects of hysteretic-EMT that resonates into spreading the EMT across cancer cell populations and its epigenetic mediators. For this purpose, we will use unique models of hysteresis and non-hysteresis cancer cells that we have previously generated, and inducible EMT systems with precise space and time control in 3D cultures in vitro, as well as in vivo breast cancer models. Advanced microscopy imaging, flow-cytometry analysis, ATAC-sequencing, and genome-wide DNA methylation will be used to model and unveil the mechanisms involved in the EMT spreading effect. Overall, this proposal will characterize the ability of cancer cells to amplify the EMT signal received by tumour cells, and the epigenetic mechanisms underlying it. This can lead to specific treatments to disrupt the spreading effect in order to halt cancer metastasis."
HRCS22_16615,Harnessing the metastatic mechanical microenvironment to identify signalling and metabolic cues that support breast cancer relapse,"A primary clinical challenge of breast cancer is relapse at a secondary site after tumour removal. Epidemiological and experimental studies on ER+ patients suggest the presence of disseminated dormant cancer cells (DDCCs) that remain as micro-metastases for long time, are refractory to chemotherapy, and remain quiescent until they reawaken. So far studies focused on how DDCCs reawaken; however, these results are hard to translate into clinical care, because they would result in lifelong therapies to prevent relapse. We instead propose to tackle how DDCCs survive during quiescence, with the goal of eradicating them before they wake-up. Our preliminary data suggest that the metastatic microenvironment of the lung, a clinically-relevant site of metastasis, rewires DDCCs’ metabolism. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that DDCCs isolated from lungs, cultivated on a soft extracellular matrix (ECM) and on a coculture system with lung epithelial and stromal cells share unique metabolic traits, namely SREBP/lipid synthesis and NRF2/glutathione metabolism. These results strikingly match in vitro experimental data on regulation of the same pathways by ECM softness, thus prompting us to test whether these pathways, and other adaptive metabolic traits that we propose to identify, influence survival of DDCCs. Moreover we will test if the relevant metabolic reprogramming is a shared survival strategy of DDCCs disseminated in the bone marrow, another key metastatic sites, and if common traits can be identified. We will combine regulation of ECM mechanics, a novel organ-mimicking coculture system of DDCCs and in vivo assays in animal models to study mechanisms of metabolic plasticity and address how this influences signaling pathways involved in survival. We thus propose an innovative experimental set-up, joined to strong preliminary hypotheses, to better understand how the local metastatic microenvironment reprograms DDCCs’ metabolism, with the ultimate goal of identifying new targets to hinder DDCCs survival before they relapse."
HRCS22_16642,Long noncoding RNAs as regulators of replication stress: novel targets for treatment of chemoresistant colorectal cancer,"Replication stress (RS) is the main source of DNA damage occurring to cells suffering genomic instability, due to excessive amounts of single stranded DNA at replication forks. Because of the importance of this pathway in cell survival and cancer malignancy, RS pathway is an ideal target for cancer therapy. Alterations of DNA damage response genes is a hallmark of colon cancer. This, combined with high KRAS mutation frequency affecting these tumors, make a high percentage of colon cancers dependent from RS machinery, and a worth candidate for RS pathway targeting therapies. Affecting the proteins involved in RS response is a promising therapeutic strategy currently being evaluated. However, most of the therapeutic approaches have shown limitations mainly due to cytotoxicity and activation of molecular mechanisms leading to drug resistance. However, proteins only represent a fraction of the functional molecules in our cells. A large portion of the human genome is transcribed in long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Despite lacking protein-coding capacity, lncRNAs have important cellular functions, and can be involved in genomic instability. Moreover, their highly specific regulatory roles and expression patterns postulate lncRNAs as ideal targets for therapies.  In agreement with these notions, we and other groups have focused on the study of lncRNAs as important regulators of gene functions in the context of replication. Despite emerging evidences, to date no significant knowledge on noncoding RNA based regulation of RS response is available. The aim of this project is to apply cutting-edge methodologies for the identification of lncRNAs functionally and topologically linked to RS response under RS stimuli in resistant colon cancer. We expect to identify key regulators of genomic integrity and stability. Moreover, we will explore the targeting of these lncRNAs as therapeutic anticancer options to fulfill the need of new approaches for colon cancers developing resistance to common treatments."
HRCS22_16698,MYC antagonist MNT: a new target for blood cancers,"This project explores the role of the MYC-related transcriptional repressor MNT in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Specifically, we will determine whether loss of MNT in AML driven by MLL-fusion genes enhances susceptibility of AML to apoptosis. We and others have recently shown that MYC-driven lymphomagenesis is exquisitely dependent on MNT suppression of apoptosis. Using both conditional gene deletion and targeted protein degradation approaches, we will investigate whether MLL-fusion AMLs, which express elevated MYC, are also vulnerable to MNT loss. If so, MNT becomes an exciting new target for drug development for AML, which sorely needs new therapeutic approaches."
HRCS22_16756,Inhibition of mitochondrial translation to prevent metastasis,"Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths and is often the result of therapy resistance. Metastatic processes are driven by selective survival advantages of cancer cells caused by a combination of intrinsic genetic, epigenetic and metabolic changes. Metabolic flexibility, and in particular the fast balance between glycolytic and mitochondrial energy production, is a hallmark of aggressive, invasive, and metastatic cancers. Our previous work revealed that RNA modifications occurring in transfer RNA (tRNA) shape the fast adaptation of gene expression programs to external stimuli by dynamically tuning mitochondrial and cytoplasmic translation rates. Here, we propose that the active switch to high levels of mitochondrial protein synthesis is key for metabolic reprogramming during human cancer metastasis. Using a combination of system-wide approaches, orthotopic transplantation assays and three-dimensional in vitro culture systems, we propose to (1) decipher the underlying mechanism how dynamic regulation of mitochondrial translation promotes metastasis; (2) identify the tumour-initiating cell population requiring mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming to undergo metastasis; and (3) test inhibitors of mitochondrial translation in the prevention and treatment of metastasis. Our research plan will unravel the functional role of the mitochondrial translation machinery in tumourigenesis and determine how this genome-independent control mechanism contributes to cancer metastasis. Our approach to use specific inhibitors of mitochondrial translation in the prevention and treatment of cancer metastasis may offer a new therapeutic strategy that can be immediately optimised further for clinical studies."
HRCS22_16792,Unveiling the evolutionary processes and molecular pathways underlying the development and progression of lung neuroendocrine neoplasms,"Background. It has been widely accepted that well-differentiated, low-grade typical and intermediate-grade atypical pulmonary carcinoids have unique clinico-histopathological traits with no causative relationship or genetic, epidemiologic, or clinical traits in common with poorly-differentiated, high-grade LCNECs (large-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas) and SCLCs (small-cell lung cancers). However, we have recently identified a group of atypical carcinoids (named supra-carcinoids) that exhibit genuine carcinoid-like morphology but molecular and clinical features of LCNEC, challenging the above-mentioned general belief. Project objectives and research approach. We hypothesize that atypical carcinoids can evolve from typical carcinoids and that a subgroup of atypical carcinoids might progress to high-grade lung neuroendocrine neoplasms. To test our hypothesis we will take advantage of a unique biorepository, a multidisciplinary team, and an innovative research approach to study the evolutionary processes of pulmonary carcinoids through multi-region, multi-omic analyses of 20 primary pulmonary carcinoid patients. Expected results. The experiments that we propose will allow us to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of lung neuroendocrine neoplasm initiation and progression. We also expect to reveal vulnerabilities that will have meaningful implications for the treatment and stratification of patients with these tumor types. Additionally, the methods and techniques we will develop for the analysis of multi-region, multi-omic data will be applicable to most of the cancer types, allowing other researchers to design similar studies."
HRCS22_16839,Examining the role of the pathogenic bone marrow microenvironment and hematopoietic stem cell stress in the development of leukaemia in blood cancer predisposition,"Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML) are aggressive haematological malignancies with poor clinical outcomes. Germline drivers are recognized to account for over 10-15% of all blood cancers, often caused by mutations in DDX41, GATA2 and RUNX1. An inherited predisposition to blood cancer is associated with many serious clinical risks throughout life, including life threatening infection and bone marrow failure due to defective production and function of blood cells; and the subsequent development of leukaemia. Little is understood about the transition from predisposition to overt leukaemia. We have shown that somatic mutations may signal leukaemic progression, but this is not always the case. Clinical histories indicate that environmental stressors, including exposure to infectious agents, viral and bacterial, may influence the HSC, both driving adaptive genetic change and creating a permissive environment for leukaemia development. However the contribution of predisposition mutations to HSC fitness and the pathogenic micro-environment that is essential for the establishment of disease, has largely been overlooked. We have established mouse models of pathogenic predisposition mutations in RUNX1, GATA2 and DDX41; primary bone marrow stromal cell models from carriers; and a state of the art humanised bone marrow ossicle xenotransplantation mouse model. Using these and, primary patient samples through our Australian Familial Haematological Cancer Study, we are in a unique position to perform experiments to establish if mutations in predisposition genes in the bone marrow microenvironment and HSC cross talk to establish MDS/AML, and examine the role of environmental HSC stressors play in influencing this process. These studies will provide new insights into the factors and mechanisms that influence leukaemia development, potentially uncovering new therapeutic targets and strategies for prevention of leukaemia."
HRCS22_16877,Probing the mechanisms of chemotherapy response in ovarian cancers according to their centrosome status,"Centrosomes are the major microtubule organizing center of animal cells, playing essential functions in intracellular organization, cell polarity, and cell division. Centrosome numbers are tightly controlled during the cell cycle to ensure that prior to mitosis cells contain two centrosomes to assemble a bipolar mitotic spindle. Centrosome amplification, the presence of more than two centrosomes in a cell, has been described as a common feature of human cancers and it is known to promote tumorigenesis when induced in animals. However, little is known about the real status of centrosome numbers in human cancers and whether centrosome numerical alterations are solely associated with poor prognosis. To address this question, we have analysed a large cohort of human high grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs) from 100 patients using state-of-the-art microscopy to determine the centrosome-nucleus index (CNI) of each tumour. We found that HGSOCs are highly heterogeneous, but surprisingly, even if presenting higher CNI than healthy tissues, centrosome amplification was not frequent. Strikingly, we found that high CNI correlates with better sensitivity to chemotherapy and so better patient outcome. Using ovarian cancer cellular models to manipulate centrosome numbers and patient derived xenographs (PDXs), we confirmed these results and found that higher CNI results in a better response to chemotherapy. Our findings highlight a novel paradigm linking centrosome number alterations and tumour progression. In this proposal we will use in vitro and in vivo experimentation to mechanistically investigate how centrosome amplification influence the response to chemotherapy and more importantly its outcome in terms of proliferative capacity and cell fate. This work will generate new insights on how HGSOCs responds to chemotherapy, while providing novel concepts linking the positive contribution of the microtubule cytoskeleton to influence patient survival."
HRCS22_16942,Uncovering the dynamic plasticity of the bone microenvironment in breast cancer metastasis,"Mortality from breast cancer is almost exclusively a result of tumor metastasis, and bone metastasis occur in ~ 75% of patients with advanced disease. Thus, understanding the biology of tumor metastasis is the most significant challenge in cancer research today. The tumor microenvironment was shown to be crucial in supporting tumor growth. However, the role of the bone metastatic microenvironment in the multistage process of metastasis is largely unresolved. The main goal of this study is to uncover the dynamic plasticity of the bone microenvironment, that orchestrates the formation of a hospitable metastatic niche for breast cancer metastasis.  To address this challenge, we will perform profiling at the single cell level of stromal cells isolated from the bone metastatic microenvironment. We will combine mouse models of spontaneous bone metastasis in immune competent mice, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), patient samples of bone metastasis and functional pre-clinical experiments. This unique comprehensive approach will enable us to systematically investigate, for the first time, the diverse transcriptional and functional landscape of stromal cell subpopulations in the metastatic microenvironment. This knowledge is expected to result in the discovery of actionable nodes for intervention. We will apply pharmacological and genetic tools to target these nodes, and perform pre-clinical trials in an effort to inhibit breast cancer metastatic relapse. Our study will provide a high-dimensional map of the dynamic plasticity and functional variability that underlie the rewiring of the bone metastatic microenvironment, and provide novel mechanistic insights on the molecular changes at the metastatic niche that facilitate the ability of disseminated tumor cells to colonize a hostile microenvironment. Understanding the early events that support metastases formation, and the discovery of metastatic niche markers and functional targets are key to the development of effective therapeutic strategies that may prevent metastatic relapse."
HRCS22_17073,PREDiCt-MM: Investigation Of The Paracrine Roles Of Extracellular Vesicle Derived Chemokines In Malignant Melanoma Progression,"Melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer, responsible for most skin cancer deaths. We still know very little about how melanoma spreads through the body. We need this knowledge to produce better treatments. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small packets that carry messages between cells, helping cancer cells grow and spread through the body. We will test the role of these EVs in melanoma, looking at messengers in them, known as chemokines. We will undertake this on cells in the laboratory, and blood samples from humans and our companion animal, the dog.   Dogs, like humans, can have melanoma and are treated with surgery and chemotherapy. Melanoma in dogs can also spread, and in general spreads faster than in humans. This quicker progression and survival time will allow us to find results in a shorter time.   The dogs in this project are pets, who develop melanoma naturally and are undergoing treatment with their Vet. We will only use blood samples from the dogs taken as part of their usual treatment, that would be thrown away otherwise. We will not be giving dogs melanoma.  We hope to find new ways to treat melanoma and pick it up earlier in both humans and dogs."
HRCS22_17447,The role of interclonal communication and the tumour microenvironment in driving paediatric GBM and DIPG migration and invasion,"Tumour invasion is one of the major challenges in cancer therapy and this is especially true for highly aggressive tumours like paediatric glioblastoma (pGBM) and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Children affected by those tumours have a very poor outcome and no effective treatment despite an increased knowledge of the biology of the disease. pGBM and DIPG have been found to harbour specific driver mutations in histone genes but they are also highly heterogeneous tumours, characterised by a complex subclonal architecture which may drive their infiltrative growth and early spread through the CNS. Understanding the interclonal dynamics within these tumours, and the way they adapt and respond to their microenvironment may offer new therapeutic opportunities to improve outcomes in pGBM/DIPG patients. I propose to characterise the mechanisms by which pGBM/DIPG cells migrate and invade, and identify the key factors that mediate these processes. I will focus on the heterogeneous cell-cell interactions which take place between tumour subclones and with the specific microenvironments of the brain, combining advanced imaging and proteomic analysis coupled to specific drug screens to identify new ways to target pGBM/DIPG migration/invasion."
HRCS22_17675,Next Generation T cell therapies for childhood cancers (NexTGen),"BACKGROUND: Current treatments fail to cure many children with solid cancers. Recent advances in adult cancers such as checkpoint blockade and targeted small molecules have made little impact in childhood disease.  Engineered T-cell therapies can achieve durable responses in refractory lymphoid cancers without long-term toxicity. These are precisely the characteristics required for new treatments for pediatric solid cancers.  In contrast to hematologic malignancies, solid cancers are challenging due to a lack of targets, tumor heterogeneity, and hostile tumor microenvironment (TME). We posit that through advanced cellular engineering we can overcome these challenges. Our vision is that engineered T-cell therapy for childhood solid cancers will become routine within a decade.  Our central hypothesis is that coupling of advanced cellular engineering along with progressive clinical development is the fastest route to developing effective T-cell therapies for pediatric solid tumors. In NGTC we combine detailed studies of primary tumors to discover new targets and understand how the TME subverts T-cell function. This, along with a closely coupled clinical development programme will guide the progressive engineering of T-cells to result in transformative therapies.  NGTC is composed of 6 inter-connected work-packages (WPs) with work initially focused on pediatric sarcomas and brain tumors.  AIMS: WP1: To identify suitable targets for engineered T-cells.  WP2: To understand the TME in pediatric solid cancers.  WP3: To develop receptors and other engineering components which target tumor cells and resist or modulate the TME.  WP4: To evaluate the function of engineered T-cells developed in WP3.  WP5: To translate approaches from WP4 and test them in clinical studies designed for maximal impact.  WP6: To promote data sharing across all WPs  METHODS: Target discovery (WP1) and TME studies (WP2) will utilize mass spectroscopy and chip cytometry respectively. Component engineering (WP3) will use protein engineering methods. To model engineered cell function, WP4 will mostly use intact tumor models such as immune PDXs. In WP5, clinical product generation will involve autologous closed system semi-automated manufacturing. WP6 uses standard and custom databases and data sharing platforms.  USE OF RESULTS: Tumor target and TME data from WP1 and 2 will be uploaded to databases developed by WP6 for widespread distribution. Engineering components from WP3 and functional data from WP4 will be available for incorporation into therapeutic T-cell strategies by the entire community. Clinical study data from WP5 should lead to registration studies, improving cure rates and mitigation of long-term toxicity to realize our Vision."
HRCS22_17914,Timing and Duration of Breastfeeding and Childhood Brain Tumor Risk,"Childhood brain tumours (CBT) have poor survival with potentially devastating long-term treatment effects. Furthermore, in contrast to many other cancers, few modifiable risk factors have been identified. Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce the risk of infection, asthma, and other childhood illnesses (1). We and others have also reported a decreased risk for childhood leukaemia among those who are breastfed and an increased risk among those who are fed formula, especially for longer durations (2-5). To date, few studies have been adequately powered to examine these questions for CBT. A recent meta-analysis of 899 CBT cases (5 studies) provides some limited evidence of an association for ever breastfeeding; yet additional meta-analysis of a smaller number of studies suggests that the inverse association maybe stronger for longer durations (>6 months) of breastfeeding (5). This preliminary evidence suggests that the association between breastfeeding and CBT risk may be more nuanced than has been observed for childhood leukaemia."
HRCS22_17975,Investigating metabolic mechanisms driving childhood brain cancer,"Our goal is to characterize the metabolic mechanisms driving childhood brain cancer and to investigate a dietary strategy for prevention. Gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumours in children, and have surpassed leukemia as the leading cause of death. The rising incidence of high-grade pediatric gliomas (HGG) in the UK and US requires immediate action for management and prevention. The well-documented defects in mitochondrial respiratory function cause HGG to depend on glucose and the amino acid glutamine for fermentation-dependent growth. We propose that glucose and glutamine drive HGG growth through a synergistic interaction of the glycolytic, the pentose phosphate (PPP), and the glutaminolysis pathways. A restricted ketogenic diet (KD-R) will be used to target the glycolytic, the PPP, whereas epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), aminooxyacetic acid (AOA), and CPI-613 will be used to target the glutamate dehydrogenase, the glutamate transamination, and the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase steps in the glutaminolysis pathway, respectively. Elevated ketones will protect normal neural cells from hypoglycemia. We also predict that the KD-R will facilitate delivery of the glutaminolysis inhibitors to tumours through the blood brain barrier. Support for this hypothesis will be important, as drug delivery to the pediatric brain is a major limitation to effective management of HGG. Finally, we propose that therapeutic ketosis will prevent HGG growth in the juvenile/young adult mouse brain. We will test our hypotheses in vivo using syngeneic HGG mouse models that mimic the major growth and invasive characteristics seen in humans with HGG. The findings will have immediate translational benefit."
HRCS22_18041,The value of circulating tumor DNA dynamics in patient selection for palbociclib treatment,"Addition of palbociclib to endocrine therapy greatly increases the median progression free survival (PFS) of women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The ongoing Dutch nation-wide prospective clinical SONIA trial will determine the optimal treatment line (first of second) for palbociclib addition in ER-positive MBC patients (Figure 2, project proposal).  However, to maximize palbociclib’s benefits while reducing toxicity and costs, methods are needed for timely identification of i) patients on endocrine monotherapy in need of palbociclib and ii) patients unresponsive to palbociclib.     Aims:   Primary aim: To investigate whether circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) dynamics (as a proxy for tumor load) can be used for identification of patients either in need of or unresponsive to palbociclib (depending on the study arm).  Secondary aim: To identify and biologically validate palbociclib resistance mechanisms in selected patients by investigating the extent of genetic heterogeneity and the emergence of specific genetic variants.     Techniques and Methodology:  WP1: Serial collection of blood during first line endocrine treatment with and without palbociclib from patients participating in the SONIA trial.  WP2: Mutational profiling of baseline samples with a 93-gene panel covering all major breast cancer driver genes. Identified mutations at baseline will be monitored over time in a patient-specific manner using digital PCR assays.  WP3: Extensive molecular profiling of 25 patients initially responding well to palbociclib-combination treatment at baseline and progressive disease (PD) to identify emerging potentially resistance-associated alterations in these patients. Biological relevance of the identified genes will be determined in vitro.          Impact on breast cancer research:   Results from this study will pave the way for routine use of ctDNA as a proxy for tumor load in treatment monitoring of MBC patients. In addition, more insight will be gained into currently poorly understood palbociclib resistance mechanisms, enabling better patient selection, and potentially novel treatment options."
HRCS22_18109,"eDyNAmiC (extrachromosomal DNA in Cancer) – Understanding the biology of ecDNA generation and action, and developing new ways to target these mechanisms in cancer","Human genes are arranged on 23 pairs of chromosomes, but in cancer, tumour-promoting genes can free themselves from chromosomes and relocate to circular, extrachromosomal pieces of DNA (ecDNA). These ecDNA do not follow the normal “rules” of chromosomal inheritance, enabling tumours to achieve far higher levels of cancer-causing oncogenes than would otherwise be possible, and licensing cancers with a way to evolve and change their genomes to evade treatments at rates that would be unthinkable for human cells. The altered circular architecture of ecDNAs also changes the way that the cancer-causing genes are regulated and expressed, further contributing to aggressive tumour growth. These unique features make ecDNA-containing cancers especially aggressive and difficult to treat. Cancer patients whose tumours harbour ecDNA have markedly shorter survival. Despite being first seen over fifty years ago, the critical importance of ecDNA has only recently come to light, and the scale of the problem is substantial. ecDNAs are present in nearly half of all human cancer types and up-to a third of all cancer patients. The collective current understanding of how ecDNA form, how they function, how they move around the cell, how they evolve to resist treatment, how they impact the immune system, and how they can be effectively targeted are lacking. We bring together an internationally recognized, pioneering interdisciplinary team of cancer biologists, geneticists, computer scientists, evolutionary biologists, mathematicians, clinicians, and patient advocates to boldly create novel insights and resources and to provide transformative solutions to one of Cancer’s Grand Challenges.  A core team of experienced and productive ecDNA investigators will work with new investigators in the ecDNA and cancer fields to bring completely new perspectives and approaches to this daunting challenge. By bridging cutting-edge and diverse approaches and insights from cancer genomics, yeast genetics, epigenomics, artificial genome synthesis, longitudinal patient tracking, combinatorial and machine learning algorithms, mathematical modelling, immunobiology, and innovative chemistry we will develop a new understanding of the role of ecDNA in cancer, and we will find new ways to drug the undruggable. This bold programme, which consists of 7 work packages and a committed international infrastructure, generates new and unusual collaborations that would simply be impossible under any other type of funding mechanism. Our programme endeavours to foster bold innovative solutions to one of the hardest problems in cancer and to one of the greatest challenges facing cancer patients."
HRCS22_18569,CANcer Cachexia Action Network (CANCAN),"Background: Cancer cachexia (CC) is a systemic, metabolic wasting syndrome featuring body weight loss due to skeletal muscle and adipose tissue wasting. CC is suffered by ~80% of cancer patients that causes reduced performance status, intolerance to chemotherapy, and increased mortality. This debilitating condition is poorly understood and has no effective treatment. If CC therapy existed, it would improve treatment responses, increase quality of life, and prolong survival. With 50 years of study, the field has focused on defining pathways that promote atrophy in the end-organs most affected my cachexia. While this work has been fruitful, it has not led to identification of the upstream mediators of CC, nor has it generated effective therapies. There is an urgent need for high-quality discovery science and more detailed clinical phenotyping.   We have created a virtual institute comprised of diverse, international, multidisciplinary scientists and clinicians with expertise in cancer, metabolism, neuroendocrine function, immunology, human metabolic diseases, preclinical models, and clinical phenotyping. We hypothesize that CC is driven by tumor-intrinsic factors that activate neurohormonal sickness pathways, which then induce anorexia, metabolic dysfunction, and tissue atrophy.   Aims:  Project 1 – Identification of cancer-induced systemic metabolic dysregulation.   Project 2 – Determination of tumor-immune drivers of cachexia. Project 3 – Defining the neuroendocrine response to cancer. Project 4 – Identification of clinical cachexia subtypes.  Methods: Our approach involves sophisticated measures of host-tumor interactions including innovative investigation of (1) systemic metabolic flux in mice using isotope tracing, imaging mass spectroscopy, dynamic nuclear imaging, and dietary and pharmacologic interventions; (2) cellular components and secreted factors from the tumor microenvironment using imaging mass cytometry, patient-derived organoid xenografts, microbial toxins, and CRISPR-based manipulations; (3) central pathways regulating appetite, behavior, and peripheral organ metabolism using human metabolic phenotyping, optogenetic, and pharmacological methods. We will perform the largest, most comprehensive observational study in CC subjects to thoroughly define CC subtypes and their clinical biomarkers using epidemiologic tools, novel image segmentation algorithms, and cluster analyses.  How the results will be used: (1) Develop dietary and pharmacological strategies to reverse metabolic dysfunction. (2) Develop pharmacologic strategies to manipulate the cells, secreted factors, and microbiota that promote CC. (3) Target the pertinent central pathways regulating appetite and sickness behavior. (4) Identify blood, imaging, and histologic biomarkers that define clinically relevant subsets of CC.  (5) Establish CC “centers of excellence” that will deliver high quality, multi-modal therapy and serve as recruitment centers for future clinical trials."
HRCS22_18789,PROMINENT: Discovering the molecular signatures of cancer PROMotion to INform prevENTion,"Abstract  Background The cancer research community is on the verge of a major leap in our understanding of the factors that contribute to human cancer risk. While it is clear that mutations in DNA, either spontaneous or environmentally induced, are essential for cancer development, recent advances have highlighted the importance of non-mutagenic factors as rate-limiting determinants of cancer risk in human populations and in mouse cancer models. The root causes of human cancer have been widely debated, but most of the emphasis has been on the origins of the “driver” mutations that are ubiquitous in human tumours. Although epidemiology studies have highlighted the possible roles of lifestyle factors such as obesity, alcohol consumption, inflammation and poor diet in cancer risk, it has generally been assumed that these act directly or indirectly to cause mutations in DNA, thus contributing to tumour mutational burden resulting in increased cancer risk. In contrast, recent sequencing studies have uncovered abundant mutations in normal human tissues, suggesting that even strong cancer driver mutations are not sufficient for cancer formation.  These results were presaged by studies of mouse tumour models, some carried out more than 50 years ago, showing that promotion is the rate-limiting step in tumour development.   Aims and Methods To identify the mechanisms that control mutated normal cells, and to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which promoting factors stimulate the conversion of these cells to neoplastic growth, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team of investigators with wide-ranging experience in epidemiology, genetics, computational network analysis and machine learning, tissue imaging of gene expression, single cell transcriptomics, and genome-wide CRISPR functional screens . We will focus on a unique collection of several thousand human normal and matched tumour samples from >20 countries, including regions of both high and low cancer risk. Detailed risk factor information and whole genome sequence data is available from all these samples as part of the Grand Challenge Mutographs study.  Analysis of these samples, together with detailed intervention studies in human populations, mouse models and human organoids, will  allow us to develop a roadmap of tumour promotion from single normal cells carrying driver mutations, through to malignant progression. These studies will facilitate identification of the causative environmental factors that promote cancer,  and provide routes to new methods and approaches to cancer prevention based on a deeper understanding of the process of initiated cell selection by tumour promoting agents."
HRCS22_18806,Exploiting the Epigenome to Control Cancer-Promoting Gene-Expression Programs in Breast Cancer Brain Metastasis,"Background:  Despite the development of many treatment options targeting breast cancer, up to 30% of patients with secondary disease are likely to develop brain metastasis and ultimately succumb to metastatic progression. A major limitation in the development of targeted anti-metastatic therapies specific to brain metastasis is a lack of understanding of the biological drivers of this process.   Aims:   The main aim of this project is to gain a better understanding of brain metastasis by identifying underlying epigenetic alterations. The project will focus on evaluating the efficacy of epigenetic-modulating therapies in brain metastasis and defining the epigenetic changes that drive brain metastasis progression. Overarching aim is to identify new treatment strategies that may improve patient outcomes.  Technique and Methodology:  Epigenomic landscape of brain metastatic tumour material in a cohort of patient-matched primary and metastatic tissues will be profiled using RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and computational approaches. Brain metastasis-specific alterations in promoter and enhancer H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 activity will classify aberrant gene activity and identify enriched epigenetic/transcription factors orchestrating the epigenetic re-programming. The potential to modify and target the identified pro-metastatic epigenetic programmes will be investigated using a large screen of epigenetic-modulating therapies in wide-ranging  in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo pre-clinical models of breast cancer brain metastasis.  Impact on breast cancer research:  Brain metastasis represents one of the most devastating aspects of breast cancer.  Discovering epigenetic changes that occur during progression and development of brain metastasis will reveal key cancer drivers. Successful completion of the proposed aims will provide crucial insight into the mechanism underlying the most malevolent step of metastatic spread, thereby establishing the molecular foundation necessary to develop new treatments and strategies that will lead to improving long-term outcomes and quality of life of brain metastasis patients."
HRCS22_19013,OPTIMISTICC: OPportunity To Investigate the Microbiome’s Impact on Science and Treatment In Colorectal Cancer,"Summary of Work Package 2 ""Epidemiological correlates of the colorectal cancer microbiome""  Dietary, lifestyle, and environmental factors can all influence the structure and function of the gut microbiome. Likewise, many of these factors also contribute to carcinogenesis, potentially through modifying the microbiome and/or its interactions with the intestinal epithelium. To better understand the role of these aetiologic factors in tumour development, we will examine key epidemiologic features in relation to the tumor tissue microbiome, and incidence of bowel tumors subclassified by tumor microbial features. Among exposures, we will analyze demographics (where individuals have lived); ethnicity; socioeconomic status; fibre and other components of diet; consumption of alcohol, sugar-sweetened beverages, coffee and tea; smoking; physiological and physical activity indices such as body mass index, exercise, sedentary lifestyle, sleeping habits, and bowel movements; and use of medications (such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and statins). In addition, we will analyze the tumour microbiome according to biogeography within the colon and rectum. Local, biogeographical features will thus be analysed alongside environmental and lifestyle factors in the assessment of their interactions with the tumour microbiome. The analyses proposed for WP2 will have impact in two ways. First, the long-term history and future follow-up of the epidemiological cohorts enables the creation of a valuable data resource for future studies of the tumor tissue microbiome, in addition to those already proposed here. This Work Package 2 can drive future studies of the colorectal cancer (CRC) microbiome as additional technologies (e.g. long-read or single-cell microbial sequencing) become practical at epidemiologic scale. Second, understanding the influence of specific dietary components and other environmental factors in altering gut microorganisms and their roles in colorectal cancer will help us to discover novel mechanisms of cancer progression and outcome. Our study overall thus holds the potential both to develop novel early-stage diagnostics predicting the onset or outcome of CRC and to engineer personalized preventative and therapeutic measures to reduce an individual’s risk of developing colorectal cancer and of progressing to more advanced disease."
HRCS22_19170,"Artificial intelligence to automate the use of radiotherapy to treat acute oncological conditions such as severe pain, bleeding and neurological symptoms in patients with advanced cancers","Radiotherapy is both inaccessible and unaffordable for the majority of patients diagnosed with cancer in low and middle income countries due to shortfalls in basic infrastructure, equipment and specialist manpower. Eighty-percent of patients in these settings are diagnosed with locally advanced or widely disseminated cancers. We will use artificial intelligence to automate radiotherapy plan preparation for acute oncological conditions in patients with a diverse range of advanced cancers that are endemic in these country settings such as cervical, breast and head and neck cancers. This will mean that patients can be treated very quickly after receiving a CT scan, rather than waiting days or weeks as is the current norm. This will directly benefit patients in LMICs by increasing the likelihood of palliating symptoms of disseminated malignancy (pain, bleeding, shortness of breath, spinal cord compression), improving long term control of cancer, and reducing the cost of treatment."""
HRCS22_19268,STrOmal ReprograMing (STORMing) Provides New Directions to Prevent and Revert Chronic Inflammation-Associated Cancers,"Most cancer therapies are designed to kill rapidly growing cells, which leads to debilitating side effects. Storming Cancer comes at this from an entirely new perspective – we propose to develop ‘cancer-normalizing’ therapeutics that prevent cancer formation or revert cancers to become non-malignant tissues - Chronic inflammation (CI) is a key contributor to the development of many cancers, yet little is known about how this works. Our goal is to understand how CI promotes cancer formation, and to leverage this knowledge to develop new types of ‘cancer normalization’ therapy - Our working hypothesis based on past work from our team and others, is that CI-associated carcinogenesis in epithelial tissues results from dysregulation of the underlying connective tissue stroma – a previously underexplored “cause” of cancer - Understanding cancer as a disease of dysregulation of tissue-tissue interactions, as opposed to a defect of the cell, opens enormous new therapeutic opportunities - By systematically characterizing the microanatomy, biochemistry, biomechanics, and genomic properties of disease-free, CI-associated metaplastic, dysplastic and cancerous regions of clinical tissue specimens from the same patients, and engineering novel in vitro and in vivo models using cells isolated from these same samples, we will gain novel insights into how CI tips normal tissues into a cancer-promoting mode. - Storming Cancer will bring novel bioinformatics, machine learning, and system biology-based cell reprogramming approaches to develop innovative cancer treatments that are not only successful in preventing and reversing cancer, but are far more tolerable for the patient, enhancing both quantity and quality of life"
HRCS22_19390,Mutographs of Cancer: discovering the causes of cancer through mutational signatures,"Background Discovery of environmental exposures, lifestyle factors, infectious agents and inherited mutated genes that cause cancer has led to some successful cancer prevention programmes. However, understanding of the causes of cancer remains incomplete and there exist substantial geographical and temporal differences in cancer incidence that are unexplained. Cancers are caused by somatic mutations. These result from multiple mutational processes including exogenously or endogenously derived DNA damage, DNA repair, DNA editing and DNA replication. Each mutational process is associated with a distinct pattern of somatic mutations, termed a “mutational signature”. Mathematical methods deconvoluting mutational signatures have been developed and reveal more than 40 signatures across human cancer. However, the causes and biological mechanisms underlying many are unknown.  Aims Through the study of mutational signatures we aim to explain major global differences in cancer incidence, to understand the biological mechanisms underlying cancer-causing mutational processes and to explore their application towards surveillance of mutagenic exposures in human populations.   Methods We will collect samples and epidemiological information from 5000 individuals with cancers of the colorectum, pancreas, kidney and oesophagus from regions of exceptionally high or low cancer incidence on five continents. These will be DNA sequenced to find mutational signatures with differing mutation burdens in cancers from high and low incidence areas and to correlate these differences with epidemiological risk factors such as obesity and environmental exposures. We will DNA sequence rodent tumours and organoid cultures exposed to carcinogenic chemicals, radiations and biological factors to generate a compendium of mutational signatures of known origins. We will DNA sequence cells from normal tissues from people exposed to carcinogens to characterise their early effects and explore the feasibility of monitoring exposures. We will further elaborate computational methods for mutational signature analysis and develop mathematical models of cancer initiation incorporating mutational signatures.  How the results of this research will be used Discovery of mutational signatures of known cause in cancer genomes will lead to programmes to reduce exposure and prevent cancer. If the signature cause is unknown, similarity to an experimentally induced signature may inform on its origin. Association of signatures with complex epidemiological risk factors for cancer will elucidate their mechanism of action. Analysis of normal tissues will lead to understanding of early mutagenesis and methods of surveillance and monitoring"
HRCS22_19406,IMAXT : imaging and molecular annotation of xenografts and tumor,"We propose to develop an entirely new way for scientists and physicians to understand cancer and predict its clinical behaviour. Our integrated approach will produce faithful three-dimensional representations of tumours and their host environments, wherein each cell is identified and molecularly annotated. These models will be presented in an interactive, virtual reality (VR) framework. Investigators will literally be able to walk inside a tumour, visualize the arrangement of tumour cells in relation to each environmental cell type, and perform interactive comparative molecular analyses in real time. We call this project IMAXT, Imaging and Molecular Annotation of Xenografts and Tumours. This approach harnesses our innate pattern recognition capabilities while maintaining the statistical rigour of molecular measurements. We wish not only to provide research tools that allow us to better understand how cancer develops and responds to therapy but also to transform the way that patients are diagnosed and treatments planned. Though this approach will be applicable to nearly all tumour types, we will begin in breast cancer, where both inter- and intra-individual heterogeneity are apparent and inform treatment decisions and prognosis"
HRCS22_20766,Prevent Ductal Carcinoma in Situ Invasive Overtreatment Now - PRECISION,"Background  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) now represents 20-25% of all breast neoplasia. This is due to large-scale detection by widely adopted population-based breast cancer screening programs . As a result, thousands of women are confronted with DCIS each year: more than 8,000 in the UK, 2,300 in the Netherlands, and over 50,000 in the US. Conventional management includes surgery, supplemented by radiotherapy and/or endocrine therapy, but overtreats the majority of DCIS as ~1% recur annually and breast cancer mortality is ~3% at 20 years. Uncertainty as to which DCIS lesions will progress to invasive cancer or, after excision, which will return with recurrent DCIS or invasive breast cancer drives this overtreatment. Distinguishing DCIS that may progress to lethal disease from the majority of harmless DCIS is therefore an urgent need to save thousands of women with low risk DCIS the burden of radical treatment without any survival benefit.    Aim  We aim to reduce the burden of overtreatment of DCIS (surgery, radiation therapy, hormonal therapies) through the development of novel tests that promote informed and shared decision-making between patients and clinicians, without compromising the excellent outcomes for DCIS management presently achieved.    Methods  First, three large retrospective DCIS cohorts (and supplementary sources) will be collected enabling subsequent in depth molecular studies. Second, extensive genomic characterisation, immune profiling and imaging analysis will be performed. In vivo and in vitro modelling will be performed to study the biology of DCIS in detail. Finally, all clinical, immune, and molecular data will be incorporated into a clinical risk prediction model. This risk prediction model can be validated in three prospective DCIS trials. Specifically, in the current project we will a.) collect tissue and blood samples from these trials and b.) start validation of the biomarkers detected in the retrospective series.    How the results of this research will be used   The discoveries from our laboratory studies, including a risk stratification model, will be cross-validated in prospective trials of DCIS active surveillance versus conventional treatment (the LORIS, LORD and COMET trials). As such, the main result of this study will be that we can identify a group of women for which active surveillance for DCIS could be a safer alternative to intensive treatment. Ultimately, this may also contribute to a more reassuring perception of risk regarding non-life threatening precancerous lesions in general, reducing anxiety and preserving quality of life."
HRCS22_23505,Leveraging DNA damage repair pathways as therapeutic targets in breast cancer brain metastasis,"Background  Breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) are a frequent and aggressive form of metastatic spread; with treatment options limited for each of the clinically relevant breast cancer subtypes. To better understand potential drivers and novel targets we have we comprehensively characterised genomic, transcriptomic and clinical data from a cohort of 45 primary tumours with paired brain metastasis. Through this work, we identified (including for the first time in luminal brain metastases) the presence of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) in 45% of BCBM independently of somatic or germline BRCA1/2/PALB2 mutations.  Aims (including use of Pfizer drug)  Based on our preliminary data we hypothesize that the optimal targeting of the HRD pathways may yield improved clinical outcome in BCBMs. HRD is a common subset of BCBMs and our data suggests that these alterations may be key vulnerability in BCBM. We aim to demonstrate that HRD may be exploitable by the PARP inhibitor (PARPi), talazoparib in nonBRCA-mutated BCBMs.  Techniques and Methodology  HRD signature will be validated in an independent patient cohort. Using patient-derived BCBM organoids and tumour explants we will assess efficacy of talazoparib and in parallel evaluate blood-brain-barrier penetrance utilizing BBB 3D biometric biohybrid models and in vivo studies. Finally, we will determine molecular correlates of response to talazoparib in patients by performing mutational, gene expression and IHC studies.  Impact on breast cancer research  The outcomes of this project have the potential to considerably enhance our understanding of the significance of the high frequency alterations observed in HRD pathways in BCBM. Our efforts in delineating the clinical and functional implications of HRD in BCBM patients of all clinical subtypes will increase the cohort of patients suitable for treatment with talazoparib. This study will lead to treatment selection strategies to improve clinical management as well as patient selection strategies for future clinical trials."
HRCS22_23668,SPECIFICANCER: Dissecting the tissue specificity of cancer drivers,"Cancer is not a single disease, but rather a collection of diseases that exhibit both common and distinct properties at the molecular and cellular levels. The heterogeneous nature of cancer is reflected in the distinct genetic perturbations that arise in each form of the disease. A major unanswered question is why cancers that arise in different organs, or even different kinds of cancer from the same organ, select for mutations in distinct drivers. One possibility is that this is a passive process: some genes could drive cancer in a particular tissue, but for a variety of reasons are never mutated in the relevant cell type. Alternatively, as we believe, driver tissue specificity is an active process: the epigenetic state of cells dictates that only certain genetic perturbations are capable of driving cancer in that tissue. Through large-scale genetic screening experiments, we have discovered that normal cells derived from distinct tissues exhibit profoundly different responses to genetic perturbations that impact proliferation and survival. These differential responsiveness patterns underlie tissue specific drivers of cancer and impact recurring somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) patterns. We believe that the lack of mutations in certain tissues is as telling about the oncogenic properties of a given gene as are the common presence of mutations in other tissues. As such, the core approach of the SPECIFICANCER program is to compare the molecular and cellular manifestations of gene perturbations in tissues where mutations naturally occur and in tissues where they do not. This approach begins with gain and loss of function screens for drivers of proliferation and survival in 2D and 3D cellular models derived from different primary tissue sites. We will also explore whether cancer vulnerabilities are influenced by the epigenetic state including combinatorial changes due to multiple drivers. In parallel, we will use genetically engineered mouse models to explore the tissue-specific cancer promoting properties of mutations affecting RAS/MAPK, WNT, and PRC2. In these studies, global transcriptional, epigenetic, and proteomic measurements will be used to understand the molecular mechanisms that define tissue specificity and responsiveness to drivers. This work will generate a functional map of tissue specificity that will allow us to better interpret cancer genomics and to develop therapeutic paradigms based on the tissue-specific biology of cancer genes. We hope to improve the basic understanding of what drives cancer and to provide a rational foundation for therapeutic choices made by physicians and patients."
